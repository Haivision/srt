## Pull Requests

Submit a pull request at any time, whether an issue has been created or not. It may be helpful to discuss your goals in an issue first, though many things can best be shown with code. Also do not hesitate to ask other users for opinion and discuss the ideas using the ticketing system before you start making your changes. This is especially important in these areas:

* the build system and its variables
* the SRT library public API
* command line tools and their call syntax
* the reusable parts (such as utilities)
* SRT protocol definitions
* portability and platform-specific parts
