* [srt_cleanup](#srt_cleanup)


### srt_startup
```
int srt_startup(void);
```

This function shall be called at the start of an application that uses the SRT
library. It provides all necessary platform-specific initializations, sets up
global data, and starts the SRT GC thread. If this function isn't explicitly
called, it will be called automatically when creating the first socket. However,
relying on this behavior is strongly discouraged.

### srt_cleanup
```
int srt_cleanup(void);
```

This function cleans up all global SRT resources and shall be called just before
exiting the application that uses the SRT library. This cleanup function will still
be called from the C++ global destructor, if not called by the application, although
relying on this behavior is strongly discouraged.

|      Returns                  |                                                                 |

**IMPORTANT**: Note that the startup/cleanup calls have an instance counter.
This means that if you call [`srt_startup`](#srt_startup) multiple times, you need to call the
`srt_cleanup` function exactly the same number of times.

* [srt_getsockstate](#srt_getsockstate)
* [srt_getsndbuffer](#srt_getsndbuffer)
* [srt_close](#srt_close)


### srt_socket
```
SRTSOCKET srt_socket(int af, int type, int protocol);
```

Old and deprecated version of [`srt_create_socket`](#srt_create_socket). All arguments are ignored.

**NOTE** changes with respect to UDT version:

* In UDT (and SRT versions before 1.4.2) the `af` parameter was specifying the
socket family (`AF_INET` or `AF_INET6`). This is now not required; this parameter
is decided at the call of [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) or [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind).

* In UDT the `type` parameter was used to specify the file or message mode
using `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM` symbols (with the latter being misleading,
as the message mode has nothing to do with UDP datagrams and it's rather
similar to the SCTP protocol). In SRT these two modes are available by setting
[`SRTO_TRANSTYPE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TRANSTYPE). The default is `SRTT_LIVE`. If, however, you set
[`SRTO_TRANSTYPE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TRANSTYPE) to `SRTT_FILE` for file mode, you can then leave the
[`SRTO_MESSAGEAPI`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_MESSAGEAPI) option as false (default), which corresponds to "stream" mode
(TCP-like), or set it to true, which corresponds to "message" mode (SCTP-like).

### srt_create_socket
```
SRTSOCKET srt_create_socket();

### srt_bind
```
int srt_bind(SRTSOCKET u, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen);
```

Binds a socket to a local address and port. Binding specifies the local network
interface and the UDP port number to be used for the socket. When the local
address is a wildcard (`INADDR_ANY` for IPv4 or `in6addr_any` for IPv6), then
it's bound to all interfaces.

**IMPORTANT**: When you bind an IPv6 wildcard address, note that the
`SRTO_IPV6ONLY` option must be set on the socket explicitly to 1 or 0 prior to
calling this function. See
[`SRTO_IPV6ONLY`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_IPV6ONLY) for more details.

Binding is necessary for every socket to be used for communication. If the socket
is to be used to initiate a connection to a listener socket, which can be done,
for example, by the [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) function, the socket is bound
implicitly to the wildcard address according to the IP family (`INADDR_ANY` for
`AF_INET` or `in6addr_any` for `AF_INET6`) and port number 0. In all other cases,
a socket must be bound explicitly by using the functionality of this function first.

When the port number parameter is 0, then the effective port number will be
system-allocated. To obtain this effective port number you can use
[`srt_getsockname`](#srt_getsockname).

This call is obligatory for a listening socket before calling [`srt_listen`](#srt_listen)
and for rendezvous mode before calling [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect); otherwise it's
optional. For a listening socket it defines the network interface and the port where
the listener should expect a call request.

In the case of rendezvous mode there are two parties that connect to one another.
For every party there must be chosen a local binding endpoint (local address and port)
to which they expect connection from the peer. Let's say, we have a Party 1
that selects an endpoint A and a Party 2 that selects an endpoint B. In this case the Party 1
binds the socket to the endpoint A and then connects to the endpoint B, and the Party 2
the other way around. Both sockets must be set
[`SRTO_RENDEZVOUS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RENDEZVOUS) to *true* to make
this connection possible.

For a connecting socket the call to `srt_bind` is optional, but can be used to set up the
outgoing port for communication as well as the local interface through which
it should reach out to the remote endpoint, should that be necessary.

Whether binding is possible depends on some runtime conditions, in particular:

* No socket in the system has been bound to this port ("free binding"), or

* A socket bound to this port is bound to a certain address, and this binding is
  using a different non-wildcard address ("side binding"), or

* A socket bound to this port is bound to a wildcard address for a different IP
  version than the version requested for this binding ("side wildcard binding",
  see also `SRTO_IPV6ONLY` socket option).

It is also possible to bind to the already busy port as long as the existing
binding ("shared binding") is possessed by an SRT socket created in the same
application, and:

* Its binding address and UDP-related socket options match the socket to be bound.
* Its [`SRTO_REUSEADDR`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_REUSEADDRS) is set to *true* (default).

If none of the free, side and shared binding options is currently possible, this function
will fail. If the socket blocking the requested endpoint is an SRT
socket in the current application, it will report the `SRT_EBINDCONFLICT` error,
while if it was another socket in the system, or the problem was in the system
in general, it will report `SRT_ESOCKFAIL`. Here is the table that shows possible situations:

| Requested binding   | vs. Existing bindings...     |           |                             |               |               |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|
|                     | A.B.C.D                      | 0.0.0.0   | ::X                         | :: / V6ONLY=1 | :: / V6ONLY=0 |
| 1.2.3.4             | 1.2.3.4 shareable, else free | blocked   | free                        | free          | blocked       |
| 0.0.0.0             | blocked                      | shareable | free                        | free          | blocked       |
| 8080::1             | free                         | free      | 8080::1 sharable, else free | blocked       | blocked       |
| :: / V6ONLY=1       | free                         | free      | blocked                     | sharable      | blocked       |
| :: / V6ONLY=0       | blocked                      | blocked   | blocked                     | blocked       | sharable      |

Where:

* free: This binding can coexist with the requested binding.

* blocked: This binding conflicts with the requested binding.

* shareable: This binding can be shared with the requested binding if it's compatible.

* (ADDRESS) shareable, else free: this binding is shareable if the existing binding address is
equal to the requested ADDRESS. Otherwise it's free.

If the binding is shareable, then the operation will succeed if the socket that currently
occupies the binding has the `SRTO_REUSEADDR` option set to true (default) and all UDP
settings are the same as in the current socket. Otherwise it will fail. Shared binding means
sharing the underlying UDP socket and communication queues between SRT sockets. If
all existing bindings on the same port are "free" then the requested binding will
allocate a distinct UDP socket for this SRT socket ("side binding").

**NOTE**: This function cannot be called on a socket group. If you need to
have the group-member socket bound to the specified source address before
connecting, use [`srt_connect_bind`](#srt_connect_bind) for that purpose
or set the appropriate source address using
[`srt_prepare_endpoint`](#srt_prepare_endpoint).

**IMPORTANT information about IPv6**: If you are going to bind to the
`in6addr_any` IPv6 wildcard address (known as `::`), the `SRTO_IPV6ONLY`
option must be first set explicitly to 0 or 1, otherwise the binding
will fail. In all other cases this option is meaningless. See `SRTO_IPV6ONLY`
option for more information.

### srt_bind_acquire

```
int srt_bind_acquire(SRTSOCKET u, UDPSOCKET udpsock);
```

A version of [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind) that acquires a given UDP socket instead of creating one.

The UDP socket being acquired MUST NOT be a [connected socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html)
(not associated with the socket name of a peer),
because SRT needs to be able to set the destination address by itself.
See [#2178](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/issues/2178) for more information.

### srt_getsndbuffer

```
int srt_getsndbuffer(SRTSOCKET sock, size_t* blocks, size_t* bytes);
```

Retrieves information about the sender buffer.

**Arguments**:

* `sock`: Socket to test
* `blocks`: Written information about buffer blocks in use
* `bytes`: Written information about bytes in use

This function can be used for diagnostics. It is especially useful when the
socket needs to be closed asynchronously.

### srt_close

```
int srt_close(SRTSOCKET u);
```

Closes the socket or group and frees all used resources. Note that underlying
UDP sockets may be shared between sockets, so these are freed only with the
last user closed.

(excessive connection requests are rejected in advance).

The following important options may change the behavior of the listener
socket and the [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept) function:

* [`srt_listen_callback`](#srt_listen_callback) installs a user function that will
be called before [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept) can happen
* [`SRTO_GROUPCONNECT`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_GROUPCONNECT) option allows
the listener socket to accept group connections

### srt_accept

```
SRTSOCKET srt_accept(SRTSOCKET lsn, struct sockaddr* addr, int* addrlen);
```

Accepts a pending connection, then creates and returns a new socket or
group ID that handles this connection. The group and socket can be
distinguished by checking the `SRTGROUP_MASK` bit on the returned ID.

* `lsn`: the listener socket previously configured by [`srt_listen`](#srt_listen)
* `addr`: the IP address and port specification for the remote party
* `addrlen`: INPUT: size of `addr` pointed object. OUTPUT: real size of the
returned object

**NOTE:** `addr` is allowed to be NULL, in which case it's understood that the
application is not interested in the address from which the connection originated.
Otherwise `addr` should specify an object into which the address will be written,
and `addrlen` must also specify a variable to contain the object size. Note also
that in the case of group connection only the initial connection that
establishes the group connection is returned, together with its address. As
member connections are added or broken within the group, you can obtain this
information through [`srt_group_data`](#srt_group_data) or the data filled by
[`srt_sendmsg2`](#srt_sendmsg) and [`srt_recvmsg2`](#srt_recvmsg2).

If the `lsn` listener socket is configured for blocking mode
([`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN) set to true, default),
the call will block until the incoming connection is ready. Otherwise, the
call always returns immediately. The `SRT_EPOLL_IN` epoll event should be
checked on the `lsn` socket prior to calling this function in that case.

If the pending connection is a group connection (initiated on the peer side by
calling the connection function using a group ID, and permitted on the listener
socket by the [`SRTO_GROUPCONNECT`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_GROUPCONNECT)
flag), then the value returned is a group ID. This function then creates a new
group, as well as a new socket for this connection, that will be added to the
group. Once the group is created this way, further connections within the same
group, as well as sockets for them, will be created in the background. The
[`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE) event is raised on the `lsn` socket when
a new background connection is attached to the group, although it's usually for
internal use only.

### srt_accept_bond

```
SRTSOCKET srt_accept_bond(const SRTSOCKET listeners[], int nlisteners, int msTimeOut);
```

Accepts a pending connection, like [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept), but pending on any of the
listener sockets passed in the `listeners` array of `nlisteners` size.

**Arguments**:

* `listeners`: array of listener sockets (all must be setup by [`srt_listen`](#srt_listen))
* `nlisteners`: size of the `listeners` array
* `msTimeOut`: timeout in [ms] or -1 to block forever

This function is for blocking mode only - for non-blocking mode you should simply
call [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept) on the first listener socket that reports readiness,
and this function is actually a friendly shortcut that uses waiting on epoll and
[`srt_accept`](#srt_accept) internally. This function supports an important use
case for accepting a group connection, for which every member connection is expected
to be established over a different listener socket.

Note that there's no special set of settings required or rejected for this function.
Group-member connections for the same group can always be established over various
different listener sockets when all those listeners are hosted by the same application.
The group management is global for the application, so a connection reporting in for
an already connected group gets discovered, and the connection will be handled in the
background. This occurs regardless of which listener socket the call was made to,
as long as the connection is accepted according to any additional conditions.

This function has nothing to do with the groups. You can use it in any case when
you have one service that accepts connections to multiple endpoints. Note also
that the settings as to whether listeners should accept or reject socket or group
connections should be applied to the listener sockets appropriately prior to
calling this function.

|      Returns                  |                                                                        |

### srt_listen_callback

```
int srt_listen_callback(SRTSOCKET lsn, srt_listen_callback_fn* hook_fn, void* hook_opaque);
```

This call installs a callback hook, which will be executed on a socket that is
automatically created to handle the incoming connection on the listening socket
(and is about to be returned by [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept)), but before the
connection has been accepted.

Note the callback must be set before starting listening,
i.e. before `srt_listen` is called.

**Arguments**:

* `lsn`: Listening socket where you want to install the callback hook
* `hook_fn`: The callback hook function pointer (or NULL to remove the callback)
* `hook_opaque`: The pointer value that will be passed to the callback function

|      Returns                  |                                                            |

|       Errors                      |                                           |

| [`SRT_ECONNSOCK`](#srt_econnsock) | It can't be modified in a connected socket|
| <img width=240px height=1px/>     | <img width=710px height=1px/>                      |

The callback function has the signature as per this type definition:
```
typedef int srt_listen_callback_fn(void* opaque, SRTSOCKET ns, int hs_version
             const struct sockaddr* peeraddr, const char* streamid);
```

The callback function gets the following parameters passed:

* `opaque`: The pointer passed as `hook_opaque` when registering
* `ns`: The freshly created socket to handle the incoming connection
* `hs_version`: The handshake version (usually 5, pre-1.3 versions of SRT use 4)
* `peeraddr`: The address of the incoming connection
* `streamid`: The value set to [`SRTO_STREAMID`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_STREAMID) option set on the peer side

Note that SRT versions that use handshake version 4 are incapable of using
any extensions, such as `streamid`. However they do support encryption.
Note also that the SRT version isn't extracted at this point. However you can
prevent connections with versions that are too old by using the
[`SRTO_MINVERSION`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_MINVERSION) option.

The callback function is given an opportunity to:

* use the passed information (`streamid` and peer address) to decide
  what to do with this connection
* alter any options on the socket, which could not be set properly
  beforehand on the listening socket to be derived by the accepted socket,
  and won't be allowed to be altered after the socket is returned by
  [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept)

Note that normally the returned socket has already set all derived options from
the listener socket. The moment when this callback is called is when the conclusion
handshake has been already received from the caller party, but not yet interpreted
(the `streamid` field is extracted from it prematurely). When, for example, you set
a passphrase on the socket at this point, the Key Material processing will happen
against this passphrase, after the callback function is finished.

The callback function shall return 0, if the connection is to be accepted.
If you return -1, **or** if the function throws an exception, this will be
understood as a request to reject the incoming connection. In this case the
about-to-be-accepted socket will be silently deleted and [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept)
will not report it. Note that in case of non-blocking mode the epoll bits for
read-ready on the listener socket will not be set if the connection is rejected,
including when rejected from this user function.

**IMPORTANT**: This function is called in the receiver worker thread, which
means that it must do its checks and operations as quickly as possible. Every
delay you create in this function will burden the processing of the incoming data
on the associated UDP socket. In the case of a listener socket this means the
listener socket itself and every socket accepted off this listener socket.
Avoid any extensive search operations. It is best to cache in memory whatever
database you have to check against the data received in `streamid` or `peeraddr`.

### srt_connect

```
int srt_connect(SRTSOCKET u, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen);
```

Connects a socket or a group to a remote party with a specified address and port.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): can be an SRT socket or SRT group, both freshly created and not yet
  used for any connection, except possibly [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind) on the socket
* `name`: specification of the remote address and port
* `namelen`: size of the object passed by `name`

**NOTES:**

1. The socket used here may be [bound by `srt_bind`](#srt_bind) before connecting,
or binding and connection can be done in one function ([`srt_connect_bind`](#srt_connect_bind)),
such that it uses a predefined network interface or local outgoing port. This is optional
in the case of a caller-listener arrangement, but obligatory for a rendezvous arrangement.
If not used, the binding will be done automatically to `INADDR_ANY` (which binds on all
interfaces) and port 0 (which makes the system assign the port automatically).

2. This function is used for both connecting to the listening peer in a caller-listener
arrangement, and calling the peer in rendezvous mode. For the latter, the
[`SRTO_RENDEZVOUS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RENDEZVOUS) flag must be set
to true prior to calling this function, and binding, as described in #1,
is in this case obligatory (see `SRT_ERDVUNBOUND` below).

3. When [`u`](#u) is a group, then this call can be done multiple times, each time
for another member connection, and a new member SRT socket will be created
automatically for every call of this function.

4. If you want to connect a group to multiple links at once and use blocking
mode, you might want to use [`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group) instead.
This function also allows you to use additional settings, available only for groups.

|      Returns                  |                                                           |

| <img width=240px height=1px/>         | <img width=710px height=1px/>                      |

If the `u` socket is configured for blocking mode (when
[`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN) is set to true, default),
the call will block until the connection succeeds or fails. The "early" errors
[`SRT_EINVSOCK`](#srt_einvsock), [`SRT_ERDVUNBOUND`](#srt_erdvunbound) and
[`SRT_ECONNSOCK`](#srt_econnsock) are reported in both modes immediately. Other
errors are "late" failures and can only be reported in blocking mode.

In non-blocking mode, a successful connection can be recognized by the
`SRT_EPOLL_OUT` epoll event flag and a "late" failure by the `SRT_EPOLL_ERR`
flag. Note that the socket state in the case of a failed connection remains
`SRTS_CONNECTING` in that case.

In the case of "late" failures you can additionally call
[`srt_getrejectreason`](#srt_getrejectreason) to get detailed error
information. Note that in blocking mode only for the `SRT_ECONNREJ` error
this function may return any additional information. In non-blocking
mode a detailed "late" failure cannot be distinguished, and therefore it
can also be obtained from this function.

### srt_connect_bind

```
int srt_connect_bind(SRTSOCKET u, const struct sockaddr* source,
                     const struct sockaddr* target, int len);
```

This function does the same as first [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind) then
[`srt_connect`](#srt_connect), if called with [`u`](#u) being a socket.
If [`u`](#u) is a group, then it will execute [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind)
first on the automatically created socket for the connection.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket or group to connect
* `source`: Address to bind [`u`](#u) to
* `target`: Address to connect
* `len`: size of the original structure of `source` and `target`

|      Returns                  |                                                          |

**IMPORTANT**: It's not allowed to bind and connect the same socket to two
different families (that is, both `source` and `target` must be `AF_INET` or
`AF_INET6`), although you may mix links over IPv4 and IPv6 in one group.

This function is for developers only and can be used for testing. It does the
same thing as [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect), with the exception that it allows
specifying the Initial Sequence Number for data transmission. Normally this value
is generated randomly.

        const struct sockaddr* remote_name, int remote_namelen);
```
Performs a rendezvous connection. This is a shortcut for doing bind locally,
setting the [`SRTO_RENDEZVOUS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RENDEZVOUS) option
to true, and doing [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect).

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): socket to connect
* `local_name`: specifies the local network interface and port to bind
* `remote_name`: specifies the remote party's IP address and port

### srt_connect_callback
```
int srt_connect_callback(SRTSOCKET u, srt_connect_callback_fn* hook_fn, void* hook_opaque);
```

This call installs a callback hook, which will be executed on a given [`u`](#u)
socket or all member sockets of a [`u`](#u) group, just after a pending connection
in the background has been resolved and the connection has failed. Note that this
function is not guaranteed to be called if the [`u`](#u) socket is set to blocking
mode ([`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN) option set to true).
It is guaranteed to be called when a socket is in non-blocking mode, or when you
use a group.

Note the callback must be set before starting the connection procedure,
i.e. before `srt_connect`, `srt_connect_bind`, etc. is called.

This function is mainly intended to be used with group connections. Note that even
if you use a group connection in blocking mode, after the group is considered
connected the member connections still continue in background. Also, when some
connections are still pending and others have failed, the blocking call for
[`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group) will not exit until at least one of
them succeeds or all fail - in such a case those failures also happen only in
the background, while the connecting function blocks until all connections are
resolved. When all links fail, you will only get a general error code for the
group. This mechanism allows you to get individual errors for particular member
connection failures.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket or group that will be used for connecting and for which the hook is installed
* `hook_fn`: The callback hook function pointer (or NULL to remove the callback)
* `hook_opaque`: The pointer value that will be passed to the callback function

The callback function signature has the following type definition:

```
typedef void srt_connect_callback_fn(void* opaq, SRTSOCKET ns, int errorcode, const struct sockaddr* peeraddr, int token);
```

**Arguments**:

* `opaq`: The pointer passed as `hook_opaque` when registering
* `ns`: The socket for which the connection process was resolved
* [`errorcode`](#error-codes): The error code, same as for [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) for blocking mode
* `peeraddr`: The target address passed to [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) call
* `token`: The token value, if it was used for group connection, otherwise -1

## Socket Group Management

  * [SRT_GROUP_TYPE](#SRT_GROUP_TYPE)
  * [SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG)
  * [SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA](#SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA)
  * [SRT_MEMBERSTATUS](#SRT_MEMBERSTATUS)

### SRT_GROUP_TYPE

The following group types are collected in an [`SRT_GROUP_TYPE`](#SRT_GROUP_TYPE) enum:

* `SRT_GTYPE_BROADCAST`: broadcast type, all links are actively used at once;
* `SRT_GTYPE_BACKUP`: backup type, idle links take over connection on disturbance.

[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG

This structure is used to define entry points for connections for the
[`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group) function:

```
typedef struct SRT_GroupMemberConfig_
{
    SRTSOCKET id;
    struct sockaddr_storage srcaddr;
    struct sockaddr_storage peeraddr;
    uint16_t weight;
    SRT_SOCKOPT_CONFIG* config;
    int errorcode;
    int token;
} SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG;
```

where:

* `id`: member socket ID (filled back as output)
* `srcaddr`: address to which `id` should be bound
* `peeraddr`: address to which `id` should be connected
* `weight`: the weight parameter for the link (group-type dependent)
* `config`: the configuration object, if used (see [`srt_create_config()`](#srt_create_config))
* [`errorcode`](#error-codes): status of the connecting operation
* `token`: An integer value unique for every connection, or -1 if unused

The `srt_prepare_endpoint` sets these fields to default values. After that
you can change the value of `weight` and `config` and `token` fields. The
`weight` parameter's meaning is dependent on the group type:

* BROADCAST: not used
* BACKUP: positive value of link priority (the greater, the more preferred)

In any case, the allowed value for `weight` is between 0 and 32767.

The `config` parameter is used to provide options to be set separately on a socket
for a particular connection (see [`srt_create_config()`](#srt_create_config)).

The `token` value is intended to allow the application to more easily identify
a particular connection. If you don't use it and leave the default value of -1,
the library will set a unique value for the next connection (a 32-bit unsigned
number that will overflow by itself; the default value will be skipped).
The application can also set a unique value by itself and keep the same
value for the same connection.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

### SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA

The most important structure for the group member status is [`SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA):

```c++
typedef struct SRT_SocketGroupData_
{
    SRTSOCKET id;
    struct sockaddr_storage peeraddr;
    SRT_SOCKSTATUS sockstate;
    uint16_t weight;
    SRT_MEMBERSTATUS memberstate;
    int result;
    int token;
} SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA;
```

where:

* `id`: member socket ID
* `peeraddr`: address to which `id` should be connected
* `sockstate`: current connection status (see [`srt_getsockstate`](#srt_getsockstate)
* `weight`: current weight value set on the link
* `memberstate`: current state of the member (see below)
* `result`: result of the operation (if this operation recently updated this structure)
* `token`: A token value set for that connection (see [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG))


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

### SRT_MEMBERSTATUS

The enumeration type that defines the state of a member
connection in a group:

* `SRT_GST_PENDING`: The connection is in progress, so the socket
is not currently being used for transmission, even potentially,
and still has a chance to fail and transit into `SRT_GST_BROKEN`
without turning into `SRT_GST_IDLE`

* `SRT_GST_IDLE`: The connection is established and ready to
take over transmission, but it's not used for transmission at
the moment. This state may last for a short moment in the case of
broadcast group. In backup group this state
defines a backup link that is ready to take over when the
currently active (running) link becomes unstable.

* `SRT_GST_RUNNING`: The connection is established and at least
one packet has already been sent or received over it.

* `SRT_GST_BROKEN`: The connection was broken. Broken connections are not to be
revived. Note also that it is only possible to see this state if it is read by
[`srt_sendmsg2`](#srt_sendmsg) or [`srt_recvmsg2`](#srt_recvmsg2) just after
the link failure has been detected. Otherwise, the broken link simply
disappears from the member list.

Note that internally the member state is separate for sending and receiving. If
the `memberstate` field of [`SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA) is
`SRT_GST_RUNNING`, it means that this is the state in at least one
direction, while in the other direction it may be `SRT_GST_IDLE`. In all
other cases the states should be the same in both directions.

States should normally start with `SRT_GST_PENDING` and then turn into
`SRT_GST_IDLE`. Once a new link is used for sending data, the state becomes
`SRT_GST_RUNNING`. In the case of the `SRT_GTYPE_BACKUP` type group, if a link
is in the `SRT_GST_RUNNING` state, but another link is chosen to remain
as the only active one, this link will be "silenced" (its state will
become `SRT_GST_IDLE`).

#### srt_create_group

```
SRTSOCKET srt_create_group(SRT_GROUP_TYPE type);
```

Creates a new group of type `type`. Is typically called on the
caller side to be next used for connecting to a remote SRT listener.
The group ID is of the same domain as the socket ID, with the exception that
the `SRTGROUP_MASK` bit is set on it, unlike for socket ID.

#### srt_groupof

```
SRTSOCKET srt_groupof(SRTSOCKET member);
```

Retrieves the group SRT socket ID that corresponds to the member socket ID `member`.


|      Returns                  |                                                           |

#### srt_group_data

```
int srt_group_data(SRTSOCKET socketgroup, SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA output[], size_t* inoutlen);
```

**Arguments**:

* `socketgroup` an existing socket group ID
* `output` points to an output array
* `inoutlen` points to a variable that stores the size of the `output` array,
  and is set to the filled array's size

This function obtains the current member state of the group specified in
`socketgroup`. The `output` should point to an array large enough to hold all
the elements. The `inoutlen` should point to a variable initially set to the size
of the `output` array. The current number of members will be written back to `inoutlen`.

If the size of the `output` array is enough for the current number of members,
the `output` array will be filled with group data and the function will return
the number of elements filled. Otherwise the array will not be filled and
`SRT_ERROR` will be returned.

This function can be used to get the group size by setting `output` to `NULL`,
and providing `socketgroup` and `inoutlen`.

#### srt_connect_group

```
int srt_connect_group(SRTSOCKET group,
                      SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG name [], int arraysize);
```

This function does almost the same as calling [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) or
[`srt_connect_bind`](#srt_connect_bind) (when the source was specified for
[`srt_prepare_endpoint`](#srt_prepare_endpoint)) in a loop for every item specified
in the `name` array. However if blocking mode is being used, the first call to
[`srt_connect`](#srt_connect) would block until the connection is established,
whereas this function blocks until any of the specified connections is established.

If the group nonblocking mode is set ([`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN)
option), there's no difference, except that the [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG)
structure allows adding extra configuration data used by groups. Note also that
this function accepts only groups, not sockets.

The elements of the `name` array need to be prepared with the use of the
[`srt_prepare_endpoint`](#srt_prepare_endpoint) function. Note that it is
**NOT** required that every target address specified is of the same family.

Return value and errors in this function are the same as in [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect),
although this function reports success when at least one connection has
succeeded. If none has succeeded, this function reports an [`SRT_ECONNLOST`](#srt_econnlost)
error. Particular connection states can be obtained from the `name`
array upon return from the [`errorcode`](#error-codes) field.

The fields of [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG) structure have the following meaning:

**Input**:

* `id`: unused, should be -1 (default when created by [`srt_prepare_endpoint`](#srt_prepare_endpoint))
* `srcaddr`: address to bind before connecting, if specified (see below for details)
* `peeraddr`: target address to connect
* `weight`: weight value to be set on the link
* `config`: socket options to be set on the socket before connecting
* [`errorcode`](#error-codes): unused, should be [`SRT_SUCCESS`](#srt_success) (default)
* `token`: An integer value unique for every connection, or -1 if unused

**Output**:

* `id`: The socket created for that connection (-1 if failed to create)
* `srcaddr`: unchanged
* `peeraddr`: unchanged
* `weight`: unchanged
* `config`: unchanged (the object should be manually deleted upon return)
* [`errorcode`](#error-codes): status of connection for that link ([`SRT_SUCCESS`](#srt_success) if succeeded)
* `token`: same as in input, or a newly created token value if input was -1

|      Returns                  |                                                    |
|:----------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------- |
|   `SRT_SOCKET`                | The socket ID of the first connected member.       |
|         -1                    | Error                                              |
| <img width=240px height=1px/> | <img width=710px height=1px/>                      |


|      Errors                        |                                                           |
|:---------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`SRT_EINVPARAM`](#srt_einvparam)  | Reported if `socketgroup` is not an existing group ID. Or if bonding API is disabled. |
| [`SRT_ECONNLOST`](#srt_econnlost)  | Reported if none of member sockets has connected. |
| <img width=240px height=1px/>      | <img width=710px height=1px/>                      |

The procedure of connecting for every connection definition specified
in the `name` array is performed the following way:

1. The socket for this connection is first created

2. Socket options derived from the group are set on that socket.

3. If `config` is not NULL, configuration options stored there are set on that socket.

4. If source address is specified (that is `srcaddr` value is **not**
default empty, as described in [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG),
then the binding operation is done on the socket (see [`srt_bind`](#srt_bind)).

5. The socket is added to the group as a member.

6. The socket is connected to the target address, as specified
in the `peeraddr` field.

During this process there can be errors at any stage. There are two
possibilities as to what may happen in this case:

1. If creation of a new socket has failed, which may only happen due to
problems with system resources, then the whole loop is interrupted and no
further items in the array are processed. All sockets that got created until
then, and for which the connection attempt has at least successfully started,
remain group members, although the function will return immediately with an
error status (that is, without waiting for the first successful connection). If
your application wants to do any partial recovery from this situation, it can
only use the epoll mechanism to wait for readiness.

2. In any other case, if an error occurs at any stage of the above process, the
processing is interrupted for this very array item only, the socket used for it
is immediately closed, and the processing of the next elements continues. In the case
of a connection process, it also passes two stages - parameter check and the process
itself. Failure at the parameter check breaks this process, while if the check
passes, this item is considered correctly processed, even if the connection
attempt is going to fail later. If this function is called in blocking mode,
it then blocks until at least one connection reports success, or if all of them
fail. The status of connections that continue in the background after this function
exits can then be checked by [`srt_group_data`](#srt_group_data).

As member socket connections are running in the background, for determining
if a particular connection has succeeded or failed it is recommended
to use [`srt_connect_callback`](#srt_connect_callback). In this case the
`token` callback function parameter will be the same as the `token` value used
for the particular item in the `name` connection table.

The `token` value doesn't have any limitations except that the -1 value is
a "trap representation", that is, when set on input it will make the internals
define a unique value for the `token`. Your application can also set unique values,
in which case the `token` value will be preserved.

#### srt_prepare_endpoint

```
SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG srt_prepare_endpoint(const struct sockaddr* src /*nullable*/,
                                       const struct sockaddr* dst, int namelen);
```

This function prepares a default [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG) object as an element
of the array you can prepare for [`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group) function, filled with
additional data:

**Arguments**:

* `src`: address to which the newly created socket should be bound
* `dst`: address to which the newly created socket should connect
* `namelen`: size of both `src` and `dst`

The following fields are set by this function:

* `id`: -1 (unused for input)
* `srcaddr`: default empty (see below) or copied from `src`
* `peeraddr`: copied from `dst`
* `weight`: 0
* `config`: `NULL`
* [`errorcode`](#error-codes): [`SRT_SUCCESS`](#srt_success)

The default empty `srcaddr` is set the following way:

* `ss_family` set to the same value as `dst->sa_family`
* empty address (`INADDR_ANY` for IPv4 and `in6addr_any` for IPv6)
* port number 0

If `src` is not NULL, then `srcaddr` is copied from `src`. Otherwise
it will remain as default empty.

The `dst` parameter is obligatory. If `src` parameter is not NULL,
then both `dst` and `src` must have the same value of `sa_family`.

Note though that this function has no possibility of reporting errors - these
would be reported only by [`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group), separately
for every individual connection, and the status can be obtained from
the [`errorcode`](#error-codes) field.

Note that the `errorcode` field of the `SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG` returned would be set to `SRT_EINVOP`
if the bonding API is disabled (`ENABLE_BONDING=OFF`).

#### srt_create_config

```
SRT_SOCKOPT_CONFIG* srt_create_config();
```

Creates a dynamic object for specifying the socket options. You can add options
to be set on the socket by [`srt_config_add`](#srt_config_add) and then mount this
object into the `config` field in [`SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG`](#SRT_SOCKGROUPCONFIG)
object for that particular connection. After the object is no longer needed, you
should delete it using [`srt_delete_config`](#srt_delete_config).

|      Returns                  |                                                                    |

#### srt_delete_config

```
void srt_delete_config(SRT_SOCKOPT_CONFIG* c);
```

Deletes the configuration object.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

#### srt_config_add

```
int srt_config_add(SRT_SOCKOPT_CONFIG* c, SRT_SOCKOPT opt, void* val, int len);
```

Adds a configuration option to the configuration object.

Parameters have meanings similar to [`srt_setsockflag`](#srt_setsockflag). Note
that not every option is allowed to be set this way. However, the option (if allowed)
isn't checked if it doesn't violate other preconditions. This will be checked when
the option is being set on the socket, which may fail as a part of the connection
process done by [`srt_connect_group`](#srt_connect_group).

This function should be used when this option must be set individually on a socket
and differently for a particular link. If you need to set some option the same way
on every socket, you should instead set this option on the whole group.

The following options are allowed to be set on the member socket:

* [`SRTO_BINDTODEVICE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_BINDTODEVICE): If you want to limit binding for this link (Linux only)
* [`SRTO_CONNTIMEO`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_CONNTIMEO): If you want to give more time to connect on this link
* [`SRTO_GROUPMINSTABLETIMEO`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_GROUPMINSTABLETIMEO): To set ACK jitter tolerance per individual link
* [`SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL): If this link tends to suffer from UDP reordering
* [`SRTO_NAKREPORT`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_NAKREPORT): If you don't want NAKREPORT to work for this link
* [`SRTO_PEERIDLETIMEO`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_PEERIDLETIMEO): If you want to be more tolerant for temporary outages
* [`SRTO_RCVBUF`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVBUF): Allows for larger receiver buffer for longer recovery
* [`SRTO_SNDBUF`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_SNDBUF): Allows for larger sender buffer for slower links
* [`SRTO_SNDDROPDELAY`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_SNDDROPDELAY): When particular link tends to drop too eagerly
* [`SRTO_UDP_RCVBUF`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_UDP_RCVBUF): UDP receiver buffer, if this link has a big flight window
* [`SRTO_UDP_SNDBUF`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_UDP_SNDBUF): UDP sender buffer, if this link has a big flight window

### srt_getpeername
```
int srt_getpeername(SRTSOCKET u, struct sockaddr* name, int* namelen);
```

Retrieves the remote address to which the socket is connected.

### srt_getsockname
```
int srt_getsockname(SRTSOCKET u, struct sockaddr* name, int* namelen);
```

Extracts the address to which the socket was bound. Although you should know
the address(es) that you have used for binding yourself, this function can be
useful for extracting the local outgoing port number when it was specified as 0
with binding for system autoselection. With this function you can extract the
port number after it has been autoselected.

|      Returns                  |                                                           |

    std::cerr << "Error " << srt_getlasterror_str() << '\n';
}
```

### srt_getsockopt
### srt_getsockflag

```c++
int srt_getsockopt(SRTSOCKET u, int level /*ignored*/, SRT_SOCKOPT opt, void* optval, int* optlen);
int srt_getsockflag(SRTSOCKET u, SRT_SOCKOPT opt, void* optval, int* optlen);
```

Gets the value of the given socket option (from a socket or a group).

The first version ([`srt_getsockopt`](#srt_getsockopt)) follows the BSD socket
API convention, although the "level" parameter is ignored. The second version
([`srt_getsockflag`](#srt_getsockflag)) omits the "level" parameter completely.

Options correspond to various data types (see [API-socket-options.md](./API-socket-options.md)).
A variable `optval` of the appropriate data type has to be passed.
The integer value of `optlen` should originally contain the size of the `optval` type provided;
on return, it will be set to the size of the value returned.
For most options, it will be the size of an integer. Some options, however, use types `bool`, `int64_t`, `C string`, etc.
(see [API-socket-options.md](./API-socket-options.md#sockopt_types)).

The application is responsible for allocating sufficient memory space as defined and pointed to by `optval`.

|      Returns                  |                                                           |
|:----------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------- |

### srt_setsockopt
### srt_setsockflag

```c++
int srt_setsockopt(SRTSOCKET u, int level /*ignored*/, SRT_SOCKOPT opt, const void* optval, int optlen);
int srt_setsockflag(SRTSOCKET u, SRT_SOCKOPT opt, const void* optval, int optlen);
```

Sets a value for a socket option in the socket or group.

The first version ([`srt_setsockopt`](#srt_setsockopt)) follows the BSD socket
API convention, although the "level" parameter is ignored. The second version
([`srt_setsockflag`](#srt_setsockflag)) omits the "level" parameter completely.

Options correspond to various data types, so you need to know what data type is
assigned to a particular option, and to pass a variable of the appropriate data
type with the option value to be set.

Please note that some of the options can only be set on sockets or only on
groups, although most of the options can be set on the groups so that they
are then derived by the member sockets.

## Helper Data Types for Transmission

* [SRT_MSGCTRL](#SRT_MSGCTRL)

**NOTE:** There might be a difference in terminology used in [Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01) and current documentation.
Please consult [Data Transmission Modes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01#section-4.2)
and [Best Practices and Configuration Tips for Data Transmission via SRT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01#section-7)
sections of the Internet Draft additionally. The current section is going to be reworked accordingly.

### SRT_MSGCTRL

The [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) structure:

```c++
typedef struct SRT_MsgCtrl_
{
   int flags;                   // Left for future
   int msgttl;                  // TTL for a message, default -1 (no TTL limitation)
   int inorder;                 // Whether a message is allowed to supersede a partially lost one. Unused in stream and live mode
   int boundary;                // 0:mid pkt, 1(01b):end of frame, 2(11b):complete frame, 3(10b): start of frame
   int64_t srctime;             // Source time, in microseconds since SRT internal clock epoch
   int32_t pktseq;              // Sequence number of the first packet in received message (unused for sending)
   int32_t msgno;               // Message number (output value for both sending and receiving)
   SRT_SOCKGROUPDATA* grpdata;  // Pointer to group data array
   size_t grpdata_size;         // Size of the group array
} SRT_MSGCTRL;
```

The [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) structure is used in [`srt_sendmsg2`](#srt_sendmsg)
and [`srt_recvmsg2`](#srt_recvmsg2) calls and specifies some special extra parameters:

- `flags`: [IN, OUT]. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE (should be 0). This is
intended to specify some special options controlling the details of how the
called function should work.

- `msgttl`: [IN]. In **message** and **live mode** only, specifies the TTL for
sending messages (in `[ms]`). Not used for receiving messages. If this value
is not negative, it defines the maximum time up to which this message should
stay scheduled for sending. If TTL has expired, the message sending and further retransmissions are discarded, even
if it has never been sent so far.

- `inorder`: [IN]. In **message mode** only, specifies that sent messages should
be extracted by the receiver in the order of sending. This can be meaningful if
a packet loss has happened, and a particular message must wait for retransmission
so that it can be reassembled and then delivered. When this flag is false, the
message can be delivered even if there are any previous messages still waiting
for completion.

- `boundary`: RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE. Intended to be used in a special mode
when you are allowed to send or retrieve a part of the message.

- `srctime`:
  - [OUT] Receiver only. Specifies the time when the packet was intended to be
delivered to the receiving application (in microseconds since SRT clock epoch).
  - [IN] Sender only. Specifies the application-provided timestamp to be associated
with the packet. If not provided (specified as 0), the current time of
SRT internal clock is used.
  - For details on how to use `srctime` please refer to the [Time Access](#time-access) section.

- `pktseq`: Receiver only. Reports the sequence number for the packet carrying
out the payload being returned. If the payload is carried out by more than one
UDP packet, only the sequence of the first one is reported. Note that in
**live mode** there's always one UDP packet per message.

- `msgno`: Message number that can be sent by both sender and receiver,
although it is required that this value remain monotonic in subsequent send calls.
Normally message numbers start with 1 and increase with every message sent.

- `grpdata` and `grpdata_size`: Pointer and size of the group array. For single
socket connections these values should remain NULL and 0 respectively. When you
call [`srt_sendmsg2`](#srt_sendmsg) or [`srt_recvmsg2`](#srt_recvmsg2) function
for a group, you should pass an array here so that you can retrieve the status of
particular member sockets. If you pass an array that is too small, your `grpdata_size`
field will be rewritten with the current number of members, but without filling in
the array; otherwise both fields are updated to reflect the current connection state
of the group. For details, see the [SRT Connection Bonding: Quick Start](../features/bonding-intro.md) and
[SRT Connection Bonding: Socket Groups](../features/socket-groups.md) documents.

**Helpers for [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL):**

```
void srt_msgctrl_init(SRT_MSGCTRL* mctrl);
const SRT_MSGCTRL srt_msgctrl_default;
```

Helpers for getting an object of [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) type ready to use.
The first is a function that fills the object with default values. The second is
a constant object and can be used as a source for assignment. Note that you cannot
pass this constant object into any of the API functions because they require it
to be mutable, as they use some fields to output values.

## Transmission

* [srt_send, srt_sendmsg, srt_sendmsg2](#srt_send-srt_sendmsg-srt_sendmsg2)
* [srt_recv, srt_recvmsg, srt_recvmsg2](#srt_recv-srt_recvmsg-srt_recvmsg2)
* [srt_sendfile, srt_recvfile](#srt_sendfile-srt_recvfile)

**NOTE:** There might be a difference in terminology used in [Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01) and current documentation.
Please consult [Data Transmission Modes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01#section-4.2)
and [Best Practices and Configuration Tips for Data Transmission via SRT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-sharabayko-srt-01#section-7)
sections of the Internet Draft additionally. The current section is going to be reworked accordingly.


### srt_send
### srt_sendmsg
### srt_sendmsg2

```
int srt_send(SRTSOCKET u, const char* buf, int len);
int srt_sendmsg(SRTSOCKET u, const char* buf, int len, int ttl/* = -1*/, int inorder/* = false*/);
int srt_sendmsg2(SRTSOCKET u, const char* buf, int len, SRT_MSGCTRL *mctrl);
```

Sends a payload to a remote party over a given socket.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket used to send. The socket must be connected for this operation.
* `buf`: Points to the buffer containing the payload to send.
* `len`: Size of the payload specified in `buf`.
* `ttl`: Time (in `[ms]`) to wait for a successful delivery. See description of
the [`SRT_MSGCTRL::msgttl`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) field.
* `inorder`: Required to be received in the order of sending. See
[`SRT_MSGCTRL::inorder`](#SRT_MSGCTRL).
* `mctrl`: An object of [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) type that contains extra
parameters, including `ttl` and `inorder`.

The way this function works is determined by the mode set in options, and it has
specific requirements:

1. In **file/stream mode**, the payload is byte-based. You are not required to
know the size of the data, although they are only guaranteed to be received
in the same byte order.

2. In **file/message mode**, the payload that you send using this function is
a single message that you intend to be received as a whole. In other words, a
single call to this function determines a message's boundaries.

3. In **live mode**, you are only allowed to send up to the length of
`SRTO_PAYLOADSIZE`, which can't be larger than 1456 bytes (1316 default).

|      Returns                  |                                                           |
|:----------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------- |
|       Size                    | Size of the data sent, if successful                      |
|    `SRT_ERROR`                | In case of error (-1)                                     |
| <img width=240px height=1px/> | <img width=710px height=1px/>                      |

**NOTE**: Note that in **file/stream mode** the returned size may be less than `len`,
which means that it didn't send the whole contents of the buffer. You would need to
call this function again with the rest of the buffer next time to send it completely.
In both **file/message** and **live mode** the successful return is always equal to `len`.

### srt_recv
### srt_recvmsg
### srt_recvmsg2


```
int srt_recv(SRTSOCKET u, char* buf, int len);
int srt_recvmsg(SRTSOCKET u, char* buf, int len);
int srt_recvmsg2(SRTSOCKET u, char *buf, int len, SRT_MSGCTRL *mctrl);
```

Extracts the payload waiting to be received. Note that [`srt_recv`](#srt_recv) and
[`srt_recvmsg`](#srt_recvmsg) are identical functions, two different names being
kept for historical reasons. In the UDT predecessor the application was required
to use either the `UDT::recv` version for **stream mode** and `UDT::recvmsg` for
**message mode**. In SRT this distinction is resolved internally by the
[`SRTO_MESSAGEAPI`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_MESSAGEAPI) flag.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket used to send. The socket must be connected for this operation.
* `buf`: Points to the buffer to which the payload is copied.
* `len`: Size of the payload specified in `buf`.
* `mctrl`: An object of [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL) type that contains extra
parameters.

The way this function works is determined by the mode set in options, and it has
specific requirements:

1. In **file/stream mode**, as many bytes as possible are retrieved, that is,
only so many bytes that fit in the buffer and are currently available. Any
data that is available but not extracted this time will be available next time.

2. In **file/message mode**, exactly one message is retrieved, with the
boundaries defined at the moment of sending. If some parts of the messages are
already retrieved, but not the whole message, nothing will be received (the
function blocks or returns [`SRT_EASYNCRCV`](#srt_easyncrcv)). If the message
to be returned does not fit in the buffer, nothing will be received and
the error is reported.

3. In **live mode**, the function behaves as in **file/message mode**, although the
number of bytes retrieved will be at most the maximum payload of one MTU.
The [`SRTO_PAYLOADSIZE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_PAYLOADSIZE) value configured by the sender
is not negotiated, and not known to the receiver.
The [`SRTO_PAYLOADSIZE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_PAYLOADSIZE) value set on the SRT receiver
is mainly used for heuristics. However, the receiver is prepared to receive
the whole MTU as configured with [`SRTO_MSS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_MSS).
In this mode, however, with default settings of [`SRTO_TSBPDMODE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TSBPDMODE)
and [`SRTO_TLPKTDROP`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TLPKTDROP), the message will be
received only when its time to play has come, and until then it will be kept in the
receiver buffer. Also, when the time to play has come for a message that is next to
the currently lost one, it will be delivered and the lost one dropped.

### srt_sendfile
### srt_recvfile

```
int64_t srt_sendfile(SRTSOCKET u, const char* path, int64_t* offset, int64_t size, int block);
int64_t srt_recvfile(SRTSOCKET u, const char* path, int64_t* offset, int64_t size, int block);
```

These are functions dedicated to sending and receiving a file. You need to call
this function just once for the whole file, although you need to know the size of
the file prior to sending, and also define the size of a single block that should
be internally retrieved and written into a file in a single step. This influences
only the performance of the internal operations; from the application perspective
you just have one call that exits only when the transmission is complete.

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket used for transmission. The socket must be connected.
* `path`: Path to the file that should be read or written.
* `offset`: Needed to pass or retrieve the offset used to read or write to a file
* `size`: Size of transfer (file size, if offset is at 0)
* `block`: Size of the single block to read at once before writing it to a file

The following values are recommended for the `block` parameter:

```
#define SRT_DEFAULT_SENDFILE_BLOCK 364000
#define SRT_DEFAULT_RECVFILE_BLOCK 7280000
```

You need to pass them to the [`srt_sendfile`](#srt_sendfile) or
[`srt_recvfile`](#srt_recvfile) function if you don't know what value to chose.

## Performance Tracking

* [srt_bstats, srt_bistats](#srt_bstats-srt_bistats)

**Sequence Numbers:**
The sequence numbers used in SRT are 32-bit "circular numbers" with the most significant
bit not included. For example 0x7FFFFFFF shifted forward by 3 becomes 2. As far as
any comparison is concerned, it can be thought of as a "distance" which is an integer
value expressing an offset to be added to one sequence number in order to get the
second one. This distance is only valid as long as the threshold value isn't exceeded,
so it's understood that all sequence numbers that are anywhere taken into account are
systematically updated and kept in the range between 0 and half of the maximum 0x7FFFFFFF.
Hence, the distance counting procedure always assumes that the sequence number are in
the required range already, so for a numbers like 0x7FFFFFF0 and 0x10, for which the
"numeric difference" would be 0x7FFFFFE0, the "distance" is 0x20.


### srt_bstats
### srt_bistats
```
// Performance monitor with Byte counters for better bitrate estimation.
int srt_bstats(SRTSOCKET u, SRT_TRACEBSTATS * perf, int clear);

// Performance monitor with Byte counters and instantaneous stats instead of moving averages for Snd/Rcvbuffer sizes.
int srt_bistats(SRTSOCKET u, SRT_TRACEBSTATS * perf, int clear, int instantaneous);
```

Reports the current statistics

**Arguments**:

* [`u`](#u): Socket from which to get statistics
* `perf`: Pointer to an object to be written with the statistics
* `clear`: 1 if the statistics should be cleared after retrieval
* `instantaneous`: 1 if the statistics should use instant data, not moving averages

`SRT_TRACEBSTATS` is an alias to `struct CBytePerfMon`. For a complete description
of the fields please refer to [SRT Statistics](statistics.md).

## Asynchronous Operations (Epoll)

* [srt_epoll_create](#srt_epoll_create)
* [srt_epoll_add_usock, srt_epoll_add_ssock, srt_epoll_update_usock, srt_epoll_update_ssock](#srt_epoll_add_usock-srt_epoll_add_ssock-srt_epoll_update_usock-srt_epoll_update_ssock)

* [srt_epoll_clear_usocks](#srt_epoll_clear_usocks)
* [srt_epoll_set](#srt_epoll_set)
* [srt_epoll_release](#srt_epoll_release)

The epoll system is currently the only method for using multiple sockets in one
thread with having the blocking operation moved to epoll waiting so that it can
block on multiple sockets at once. That is, instead of blocking a single reading
or writing operation, as it's in blocking mode, it blocks until at least one of
the sockets subscribed for a single waiting call in given operation mode is ready
to do this operation without blocking. It's usually combined with setting the
nonblocking mode on a socket. In SRT this is set separately for reading and
writing ([`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN) and
[`SRTO_SNDSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_SNDSYN) respectively). This is
to ensure that if there is internal error in the application (or even possibly
a bug in SRT that has reported a spurious readiness report) the operation will end
up with an error rather than cause blocking, which would be more dangerous for the
application ([`SRT_EASYNCRCV`](#srt_easyncrcv) and [`SRT_EASYNCSND`](#srt_easyncsnd)
respectively).

The epoll system, similar to the one on Linux, relies on [`eid`](#eid) objects
managed internally in SRT, which can be subscribed to particular sockets and the
readiness status of particular operations. The [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait)
function can then be used to block until any readiness status in the whole
[`eid`](#eid) is set.


### srt_epoll_create
```
int srt_epoll_create(void);
```

### srt_epoll_add_usock
### srt_epoll_add_ssock
### srt_epoll_update_usock
### srt_epoll_update_ssock

```
int srt_epoll_add_usock(int eid, SRTSOCKET u, const int* events);
int srt_epoll_add_ssock(int eid, SYSSOCKET s, const int* events);
int srt_epoll_update_usock(int eid, SRTSOCKET u, const int* events);
int srt_epoll_update_ssock(int eid, SYSSOCKET s, const int* events);
```

Adds a socket to a container, or updates an existing socket subscription.

The `_usock` suffix refers to a user socket (SRT socket).
The `_ssock` suffix refers to a system socket.

The `_add_` functions add new sockets. The `_update_` functions act on a socket that
is in the container already and just allow changes in the subscription details. For
example, if you have already subscribed a socket with [`SRT_EPOLL_OUT`](#SRT_EPOLL_OUT)
to wait until it's connected, to change it into poll for read-readiness, you use this
function on that same socket with a variable set to [`SRT_EPOLL_IN`](#SRT_EPOLL_IN).
This will not only change the event type which is polled on the socket, but also
remove any readiness status for flags that are no longer set. It is discouraged
to perform socket removal and adding back (instead of using `_update_`) because
this way you may miss an event that could happen in the brief moment between
these two calls.

**Arguments**:

* <a name="eid">`eid`</a>: epoll container id
* <a name="u">`u`</a>: SRT socket
* <a name="s">`s`(#s)</a>: system socket
* <a name="eid">`events`</a>: points to
  * a variable set to epoll flags (see below) to use only selected events
  * NULL if you want to subscribe a socket for all events in level-triggered mode

Possible epoll flags are the following:

   * <a name="SRT_EPOLL_IN">`SRT_EPOLL_IN`</a>: report readiness for reading or incoming connection on a listener socket
   * <a name="SRT_EPOLL_OUT">`SRT_EPOLL_OUT`</a>: report readiness for writing or a successful connection
   * <a name="SRT_EPOLL_ERR">`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`</a>: report errors on the socket
   * <a name="SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE">`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`</a>: an important event has happened that requires attention
   * <a name="SRT_EPOLL_ET">`SRT_EPOLL_ET`</a>: the event will be edge-triggered

All flags except [`SRT_EPOLL_ET`](#SRT_EPOLL_ET) are event type flags (important for functions
that expect only event types and not other flags).

The [`SRT_EPOLL_IN`](#SRT_EPOLL_IN), [`SRT_EPOLL_OUT`](#SRT_EPOLL_OUT) and
[`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`](#SRT_EPOLL_ERR) events are by default **level-triggered**.
With [`SRT_EPOLL_ET`](#SRT_EPOLL_ET) flag they become **edge-triggered**.

The [`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE) flag is always edge-triggered. It
designates a special event that happens on a group, or on a listener socket that
has the [`SRTO_GROUPCONNECT`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_GROUPCONNECT) flag
set to allow group connections. This flag is triggered in the following situations:

* for group connections, when a new link has been established for a group that
is already connected (that is, has at least one connection established),
[`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE) is reported for the listener socket
accepting the connection. This is intended for internal use only. An initial
connection results in reporting the group connection on that listener. But
when the group is already connected, [`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE)
is reported instead.

* when one of a group's member connection has been broken

Note that at this time the edge-triggered mode is supported only for SRT
sockets, not for system sockets.

In the **edge-triggered** mode the function will only return socket states that
have changed since the last call of the waiting function. All events reported
in a particular call of the waiting function will be cleared in the internal
flags and will not be reported until the internal signalling logic clears this
state and raises it again.

In the **level-triggered** mode the function will always return the readiness
state as long as it lasts, until the internal signalling logic clears it.

Note that when you use [`SRT_EPOLL_ET`](#SRT_EPOLL_ET) flag in one subscription
call, it defines edge-triggered mode for all events passed together with it.
However, if you want to have some events reported as edge-triggered and others
as level-triggered, you can do two separate subscriptions for the same socket.

**IMPORTANT**: The [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait) function does not report
[`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE) events. If you need the ability to get
any possible flag, you must use [`srt_epoll_uwait`](#srt_epoll_uwait). Note that
this function doesn't work with system file descriptors.

### srt_epoll_wait
```
int srt_epoll_wait(int eid, SRTSOCKET* readfds, int* rnum, SRTSOCKET* writefds, int* wnum, int64_t msTimeOut,
                        SYSSOCKET* lrfds, int* lrnum, SYSSOCKET* lwfds, int* lwnum);
```

Blocks the call until any readiness state occurs in the epoll container.

Readiness can be on a socket in the container for the event type as per
subscription. Note that in the case when a particular event was subscribed with
[`SRT_EPOLL_ET`](#SRT_EPOLL_ET) flag, this event, once reported in this function,
will be cleared internally.

The first readiness state causes this function to exit, but all ready sockets
are reported. This function blocks until the timeout specified in the `msTimeOut`
parameter.  If timeout is 0, it exits immediately after checking. If timeout is
-1, it blocks indefinitely until a readiness state occurs.

**Arguments**:

* `eid`: epoll container
* `readfds` and `rnum`: A pointer and length of an array to write SRT sockets that are read-ready
* `writefds` and `wnum`: A pointer and length of an array to write SRT sockets that are write-ready
* `msTimeOut`: Timeout specified in milliseconds, or special values (0 or -1)
* `lwfds` and `lwnum`: A pointer and length of an array to write system sockets that are read-ready
* `lwfds` and `lwnum`: A pointer and length of an array to write system sockets that are write-ready

Note that the following flags are reported:

* [`SRT_EPOLL_IN`](#SRT_EPOLL_IN) as read-ready (also a listener socket ready to accept)
* [`SRT_EPOLL_OUT`](#SRT_EPOLL_OUT) as write-ready (also a connected socket)
* [`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`](#SRT_EPOLL_ERR) as both read-ready and write-ready
* [`SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE`](#SRT_EPOLL_UPDATE) is not reported

There is no space here to report sockets for which it's already known that the operation
will end up with error (although such a state is known internally). If an error occurred
on a socket then that socket is reported in both read-ready and write-ready arrays,
regardless of what event types it was subscribed for. Usually then you subscribe the
given socket for only read readiness, for example ([`SRT_EPOLL_IN`](#SRT_EPOLL_IN)),
but pass both arrays for read and write readiness.This socket will not be reported
in the write readiness array even if it's write ready (because this isn't what it
was subscribed for), but it will be reported there, if the next operation on this
socket is about to be erroneous. On such sockets you can still perform an operation,
just you should expect that it will always report an error. On the other hand that's
the only way to know what kind of error has occurred on the socket.

### srt_epoll_uwait
```
int srt_epoll_uwait(int eid, SRT_EPOLL_EVENT* fdsSet, int fdsSize, int64_t msTimeOut);
```

This function blocks a call until any readiness state occurs in the epoll container.
Unlike [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait), it can only be used with [`eid`](#eid)
subscribed to user sockets (SRT sockets), not system sockets.

This function blocks until the timeout specified in `msTimeOut` parameter. If
timeout is 0, it exits immediately after checking. If timeout is -1, it blocks
indefinitely until a readiness state occurs.

**Arguments**:

* `eid`: epoll container
* `fdsSet` : A pointer to an array of `SRT_EPOLL_EVENT`
* `fdsSize` : The size of the fdsSet array
* `msTimeOut` : Timeout specified in milliseconds, or special values (0 or -1):
   * 0: Don't wait, return immediately (report any sockets currently ready)
   * -1: Wait indefinitely.

**IMPORTANT**: This function reports timeout by returning 0, not by [`SRT_ETIMEOUT`](#srt_etimeout) error.

The `SRT_EPOLL_EVENT` structure:

```
typedef struct SRT_EPOLL_EVENT_
{
    SRTSOCKET fd;
    int       events;
} SRT_EPOLL_EVENT;
```

* `fd`: the user socket (SRT socket)
* [`events`](#events): event flags that report readiness of this socket - a combination
of [`SRT_EPOLL_IN`](#SRT_EPOLL_IN), [`SRT_EPOLL_OUT`](#SRT_EPOLL_OUT) and [`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`](#SRT_EPOLL_ERR).
See [srt_epoll_add_usock](#srt_epoll_add_usock) for details.

Note that when [`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`](#SRT_EPOLL_ERR) is set, the underlying socket error
can't be retrieved with `srt_getlasterror()`. The socket will be automatically
closed and its state can be verified with a call to [`srt_getsockstate`](#srt_getsockstate).

### srt_epoll_set
```
int32_t srt_epoll_set(int eid, int32_t flags);
```

This function allows setting or retrieving flags that change the default
behavior of the epoll functions. All default values for these flags are 0.
The following flags are available:

* `SRT_EPOLL_ENABLE_EMPTY`: allows the [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait) and
[`srt_epoll_uwait`](#srt_epoll_uwait) functions to be called with the EID not
subscribed to any socket. The default behavior of these function is to report
error in this case.

* `SRT_EPOLL_ENABLE_OUTPUTCHECK`: Forces the [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait)
and [`srt_epoll_uwait`](#srt_epoll_uwait) functions to check if the output array
is not empty. For [`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait) it is still allowed that
either system or user array is empty, as long as EID isn't subscribed to this
type of socket/fd. [`srt_epoll_uwait`](#srt_epoll_uwait) only checks if
the general output array is not empty.

**Arguments**:

   * `eid`: the epoll container id
   * `flags`: a nonzero set of the above flags, or special values:
      * 0: clear all flags (set all defaults)
      * -1: do not modify any flags

## Logging Control

* [srt_setloglevel](#srt_setloglevel)
* [srt_addlogfa, srt_dellogfa, srt_resetlogfa](#srt_addlogfa-srt_dellogfa-srt_resetlogfa)
* [srt_setloghandler](#srt_setloghandler)
* [srt_setlogflags](#srt_setlogflags)

SRT has a widely used system of logs, as this is usually the only way to determine
how the internals are working without changing the rules by the act of tracing.
Logs are split into levels (5 levels out of those defined by syslog are in use)
and additional filtering is possible on an FA (functional area). By default only
entries up to the *Note* log level are displayed and from all FAs.

Logging can only be manipulated globally, with no regard to a specific
socket. This is because lots of operations in SRT are not dedicated to any
particular socket, and some are shared between sockets.

### srt_setloglevel

```
void srt_setloglevel(int ll);
```

Sets the minimum severity for logging. A particular log entry is displayed only
if it has a severity greater than or equal to the minimum. Setting this value
to `LOG_DEBUG` turns on all levels.

The constants for this value are those from `<sys/syslog.h>`
(for Windows, refer to `common/win/syslog_defs.h`). The only meaningful ones are:

* `LOG_DEBUG`: Highly detailed and very frequent messages
* `LOG_NOTICE`: Occasionally displayed information
* `LOG_WARNING`: Unusual behavior
* `LOG_ERR`: Abnormal behavior
* `LOG_CRIT`: Error that makes the current socket unusable

### srt_addlogfa
### srt_dellogfa
### srt_resetlogfa

```c++
void srt_addlogfa(int fa);
void srt_dellogfa(int fa);
void srt_resetlogfa(const int* fara, size_t fara_size);
```

A functional area (FA) is an additional filtering mechanism for logging. You can
set up logging to display logs only from selected FAs. The list of FAs is
collected in the `srt.h` file, as identified by the `SRT_LOGFA_` prefix. They are
not enumerated here because they may be changed very often.

All FAs are turned on by default, except potentially dangerous ones
(such as `SRT_LOGFA_HAICRYPT`). The reason is that they may display either
some security information that shall remain in memory only (so, only
if strictly required for development), or some duplicated information
(so you may want to turn one FA on, while turning off the others).

### srt_setloghandler

```c++
void srt_setloghandler(void* opaque, SRT_LOG_HANDLER_FN* handler);
typedef void SRT_LOG_HANDLER_FN(void* opaque, int level, const char* file, int line, const char* area, const char* message);
```

By default logs are printed to standard error stream. This function replaces
the sending to a stream with a handler function that will receive them.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_setlogflags

```c++
void srt_setlogflags(int flags);
```

When you set a log handler with [`srt_setloghandler`](#srt_setloghandler), you
may also want to configure which parts of the log information you do not wish to
be passed in the log line (the `message` parameter). A user's logging facility may,
for example, not wish to get the current time or log level marker, as it
will provide this information on its own.

The following flags are available, as collected in the `logging_api.h` public header:

- `SRT_LOGF_DISABLE_TIME`: Do not provide the time in the header
- `SRT_LOGF_DISABLE_THREADNAME`: Do not provide the thread name in the header
- `SRT_LOGF_DISABLE_SEVERITY`: Do not provide severity information in the header
- `SRT_LOGF_DISABLE_EOL`: Do not add the end-of-line character to the log line

## Time Access

* [srt_time_now](#srt_time_now)
* [srt_connection_time](#srt_connection_time)

The following set of functions is intended to retrieve timestamps from the clock
used by SRT.

The sender can pass the timestamp in `MSGCTRL::srctime` of the `srt_sendmsg2(..)`
function together with the packet being submitted to SRT. If the `srctime` value
is not provided (the default value of 0 is set), SRT will use the internal clock
and assign packet submission time as the packet timestamp. If the sender wants to
explicitly assign a timestamp to a certain packet this timestamp MUST be taken
from SRT Time Access functions. The time value provided MUST equal or exceed the
connection start time (`srt_connection_time(..)`) of the SRT socket passed
to `srt_sendmsg2(..)`.

The current time value of the SRT internal clock can be retrieved using
the `srt_time_now()` function.

There are two known cases where you might want to use `srctime`:

1. SRT passthrough (for stream gateways).
You may wish to simply retrieve packets from an SRT source and pass them transparently
to an SRT output (possibly re-encrypting). In that case, every packet you read should
preserve the original value of `srctime` as obtained from [`srt_recvmsg2`](#srt_recvmsg2),
and the original `srctime` for each packet should be then passed to [`srt_sendmsg2`](#srt_sendmsg).
This mechanism could be used to avoid jitter resulting from varying differences between
the time of receiving and sending the same packet.

2. Stable timing source.
In the case of a live streaming procedure, when spreading packets evenly into the stream,
you might want to predefine times for every single packet to keep time intervals perfectly equal.
Or, if you believe that your input signal delivers packets at the exact times that should be
assigned to them, you might want to preserve these times at the SRT receiving side
to avoid jitter that may result from varying time differences between the packet arrival
and the moment when sending it over SRT. In such cases you might do the following:

    - At the packet arrival time, grab the current time at that moment using `srt_time_now()`.

    - When you want a pre-calculated packet time, use a private relative time counter
    set at the moment when the connection was made. From the moment when your first packet
    is ready, start pre-calculating packet times relative to the connection start time obtained
    from `srt_connection_time()`. Although you still have to synchronize sending times with these
    predefined times, by explicitly specifying the source time you avoid the jitter
    resulting from a lost accuracy due to waiting time and unfortunate thread scheduling.

Note that `srctime` uses an internally defined clock that is intended to be monotonic
(the definition depends on the build flags, see below). Because of that **the application
should not define this time basing on values obtained from the system functions for getting
the current system time** (such as `time`, `ftime` or `gettimeofday`). To avoid problems and
misunderstanding you should rely exclusively on time values provided by the
`srt_time_now()` and `srt_connection_time()` functions.

The clock used by the SRT internal clock is determined by the following build flags:
- `ENABLE_MONOTONIC` makes use of `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` with `clock_gettime` function.
- `ENABLE_STDXXX_SYNC` makes use of `std::chrono::steady_clock`.

The default is currently to use the system clock as the internal SRT clock,
although it's highly recommended to use one of the above monotonic clocks,
as system clock is vulnerable to time modifications during transmission.

### srt_time_now

```c++
int64_t srt_time_now();
```

Get time in microseconds elapsed since epoch using SRT internal clock (steady or monotonic clock).

### srt_connection_time

```c++
int64_t srt_connection_time(SRTSOCKET sock);
```

Get connection time in microseconds elapsed since epoch using SRT internal clock
(steady or monotonic clock). The connection time represents the time when SRT socket
was open to establish a connection. Milliseconds elapsed since connection start time
can be determined using [**Performance tracking**](#Performance-tracking) functions
and `msTimeStamp` value of the `SRT_TRACEBSTATS` (see [SRT Statistics](statistics.md)).

### srt_clock_type

```c
int srt_clock_type(void);
```

Get the type of clock used internally by SRT to be used only for informational purposes.
Using any time source except for [`srt_time_now()`](#srt_time_now) and [`srt_connection_time(SRTSOCKET)`](#srt_connection_time)
to timestamp packets submitted to SRT is not recommended and must be done with awareness and at your own risk.

| Returns | Clock Type                          | Description                                |

## Diagnostics

* [srt_getlasterror_str](#srt_getlasterror_str)
* [srt_getlasterror](#srt_getlasterror)
* [srt_strerror](#srt_strerror)
* [srt_clearlasterror](#srt_clearlasterror)
* [srt_getrejectreason](#srt_getrejectreason)
* [srt_rejectreason_str](#srt_rejectreason_str)
* [srt_setrejectreason](#srt_setrejectreason)

General notes concerning the `getlasterror` diagnostic functions: when an API
function ends up with error, this error information is stored in a thread-local
storage. This means that you'll get the error of the operation that was last
performed as long as you call this diagnostic function just after the failed
function has returned. In any other situation the information provided by the
diagnostic function is undefined.

**NOTE**: There are lists of rejection reasons and error codes at the bottom of this section.


### srt_getlasterror

```
int srt_getlasterror(int* errno_loc);
```

Get the numeric code of the last error. Additionally, in the variable passed as
`errno_loc` the system error value is returned, or 0 if there was no system error
associated with the last error. The system error is:

  * On POSIX systems, the value from `errno`
  * On Windows, the result from `GetLastError()` call


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_strerror
```
const char* srt_strerror(int code, int errnoval);
```

Returns a string message that represents a given SRT error code and possibly the
`errno` value, if not 0.

**NOTE:** *This function isn't thread safe. It uses a static variable to hold the
error description. There's no problem with using it in a multithreaded environment,
as long as only one thread in the whole application calls this function at the
moment*


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_getlasterror_str
```
const char* srt_getlasterror_str(void);
```

Get the text message for the last error. It's a shortcut to calling first
`srt_getlasterror` and then passing the returned value into [`srt_strerror`](#srt_strerror).
Note that, contrary to [`srt_strerror`](#srt_strerror), this function is thread safe.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_clearlasterror

```
void srt_clearlasterror(void);
```

This function clears the last error. After this call, `srt_getlasterror` will
report a "successful" code.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_rejectreason_str

```
const char* srt_rejectreason_str(enum SRT_REJECT_REASON id);
```

Returns a constant string for the reason of the connection rejected, as per given
code ID. It provides a system-defined message for values below `SRT_REJ_E_SIZE`.
For other values below `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED` it returns the string for
[`SRT_REJ_UNKNOWN`](#SRT_REJ_UNKNOWN). For values since `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED` on,
returns "Application-defined rejection reason".

The actual messages assigned to the internal rejection codes, that is, less than
`SRT_REJ_E_SIZE`, can be also obtained from the `srt_rejectreason_msg` array.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### srt_setrejectreason

```
int srt_setrejectreason(SRTSOCKET sock, int value);
```

Sets the rejection code on the socket. This call is only useful in the listener
callback. The code from `value` set this way will be set as a rejection reason
for the socket. After the callback rejects the connection, the code will be passed
back to the caller peer with the handshake response.

Note that allowed values for this function begin with `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED`
(that is, you cannot set a system rejection code). For example, your application
can inform the calling side that the resource specified under the `r` key in the
StreamID string (see [`SRTO_STREAMID`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_STREAMID))
is not available - it then sets the value to `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED + 404`.

|      Returns                  |                                                           |

### srt_getrejectreason

```
int srt_getrejectreason(SRTSOCKET sock);
```
This function provides a more detailed reason for a failed connection attempt. It
shall be called after a connecting function (such as [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect))
has returned an error, the code for which is [`SRT_ECONNREJ`](#srt_econnrej). If
[`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN) has been set on the socket
used for the connection, the function should also be called when the
[`SRT_EPOLL_ERR`](#SRT_EPOLL_ERR) event is set for this socket. It returns
a numeric code, which can be translated into a message by
[`srt_rejectreason_str`](#srt_rejectreason_str).


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### Rejection Reasons


#### SRT_REJ_UNKNOWN

A fallback value for cases when there was no connection rejected.


#### SRT_REJ_SYSTEM

One system function reported a failure. Usually this means some system
error or lack of system resources to complete the task.


#### SRT_REJ_PEER

The connection has been rejected by peer, but no further details are available.
This usually means that the peer doesn't support rejection reason reporting.


#### SRT_REJ_RESOURCE

A problem with resource allocation (usually memory).


#### SRT_REJ_ROGUE

The data sent by one party to another cannot be properly interpreted. This
should not happen during normal usage, unless it's a bug, or some weird
events are happening on the network.


#### SRT_REJ_BACKLOG

The listener's backlog has exceeded its queue limit (there are many other callers
waiting for the opportunity of being connected and wait in the queue, which has
reached its limit).


#### SRT_REJ_IPE

Internal Program Error. This should not happen during normal usage and it
usually means a bug in the software (although this can be reported by both
local and foreign host).


#### SRT_REJ_CLOSE

The listener socket was able to receive your request, but at this moment it
is being closed. It's likely that your next attempt will result in a timeout.


#### SRT_REJ_VERSION

One party of the connection has set up a minimum version that is required for
that connection, but the other party didn't satisfy this requirement.


#### SRT_REJ_RDVCOOKIE

Rendezvous cookie collision. This normally should never happen, or the
probability that it will happen is negligible. However this can also be
a result of a misconfiguration in that you are trying to make a
rendezvous connection where both parties try to bind to the same IP
address, or both are local addresses of the same host. In such a case
the sent handshake packets are returning to the same host as if they
were sent by the peer (i.e. a party is sending to itself). When this happens,
this reject reason will be reported by every attempt.


#### SRT_REJ_BADSECRET

Both parties have defined a passphrase for connection, but they differ.


#### SRT_REJ_UNSECURE

Only one connection party has set up a password. See also the
[`SRTO_ENFORCEDENCRYPTION`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_ENFORCEDENCRYPTION) flag.


#### SRT_REJ_MESSAGEAPI

The value of the [`SRTO_MESSAGEAPI`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_MESSAGEAPI)
flag is different on both connection parties.


#### SRT_REJ_CONGESTION

The [`SRTO_CONGESTION`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_CONGESTION)option has
been set up differently on both connection parties.


#### SRT_REJ_FILTER

The [`SRTO_PACKETFILTER`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_PACKETFILTER) option
has been set differently on both connection parties.


#### SRT_REJ_GROUP

The group type or some group settings are incompatible for both connection parties.
While every connection within a bonding group may have different target addresses,
they should all designate the same endpoint and the same SRT application. If this
condition isn't satisfied, then the peer will respond with a different peer group
ID for the connection that is trying to contact a machine/application that is
completely different from the existing connections in the bonding group.


#### SRT_REJ_TIMEOUT

The connection wasn't rejected, but it timed out. This code is always set on
connection timeout, but this is the only way to get this state in non-blocking
mode (see [`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN)).

There may also be server and user rejection codes, as defined by the
`SRT_REJC_INTERNAL`, `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED` and `SRT_REJC_USERDEFINED`
constants. Note that the number space from the value of `SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED`
and above is reserved for "predefined codes" (`SRT_REJC_PREDEFINED` value plus
adopted HTTP codes). Values above `SRT_REJC_USERDEFINED` are freely defined by
the application.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Functions & Structures](#srt-api-functions)

---

### Error Codes

All functions that return the status via `int` value return -1 (designated as
`SRT_ERROR`) always when the call has failed (in case of resource creation
functions an appropriate symbol is defined, like `SRT_INVALID_SOCK` for
`SRTSOCKET`). When this happens, the error code can be obtained from the
`srt_getlasterror` function. The values for the error are collected in an
`SRT_ERRNO` enum:


#### SRT_EUNKNOWN

Internal error when setting the right error code.


#### SRT_SUCCESS

The value set when the last error was cleared and no error has occurred since then.


#### SRT_ECONNSETUP

General setup error resulting from internal system state.


#### SRT_ENOSERVER

Connection timed out while attempting to connect to the remote address. Note
that when this happens, [`srt_getrejectreason`](#srt_getrejectreason) also reports
the timeout reason.


#### SRT_ECONNREJ

Connection has been rejected. Additional reject reason can be obtained through
[`srt_getrejectreason`](#srt_getrejectreason) (see above).


#### SRT_ESOCKFAIL

An error occurred when trying to call a system function on an internally used
UDP socket. Note that the detailed system error is available in the extra variable
passed by pointer to `srt_getlasterror`.


#### SRT_ESECFAIL

A possible tampering with the handshake packets was detected, or an encryption
request wasn't properly fulfilled.


#### SRT_ESCLOSED

A socket that was vital for an operation called in blocking mode
has been closed during the operation. Please note that this situation is
handled differently than the system calls for `connect` and `accept`
functions for TCP, which simply block indefinitely (or until the standard
timeout) when the key socket was closed during an operation. When this
error is reported, it usually means that the socket passed as the first
parameter to [`srt_connect*`](#srt_connect) or [`srt_accept`](#srt_accept)
is no longer usable.


#### SRT_ECONNFAIL

General connection failure of unknown details.


#### SRT_ECONNLOST

The socket was properly connected, but the connection has been broken.
This specialization is reported from the transmission functions.


#### SRT_ENOCONN

The socket is not connected. This can be reported also when the connection was
broken for a function that checks some characteristic socket data.


#### SRT_ERESOURCE

System or standard library error reported unexpectedly for unknown purpose.
Usually it means some internal error.


#### SRT_ETHREAD

System was unable to spawn a new thread when required.


#### SRT_ENOBUF

System was unable to allocate memory for buffers.


#### SRT_ESYSOBJ

System was unable to allocate system specific objects (such as
sockets, mutexes or condition variables).


#### SRT_EFILE

General filesystem error (for functions operating with file transmission).


#### SRT_EINVRDOFF

Failure when trying to read from a given position in the file (file could
be modified while it was read from).


#### SRT_ERDPERM

Read permission was denied when trying to read from file.


#### SRT_EINVWROFF

Failed to set position in the written file.


#### SRT_EWRPERM

Write permission was denied when trying to write to a file.


#### SRT_EINVOP

Invalid operation performed for the current state of a socket. This mainly
concerns performing `srt_bind*` operations on a socket that is already bound.
Once a socket has been been bound, it cannot be bound again.


#### SRT_EBOUNDSOCK

The socket is currently bound and the required operation cannot be
performed in this state. Usually it's about an option that can only
be set on the socket before binding (`srt_bind*`). Note that a socket
that is currently connected is also considered bound.


#### SRT_ECONNSOCK

The socket is currently connected and therefore performing the required operation
is not possible. Usually concerns setting an option that must be set before
connecting (although it is allowed to be altered after binding), or when trying
to start a connecting operation ([`srt_connect*`](#srt_connect)) while the socket
isn't in a state that allows it (only [`SRTS_INIT`](#SRTS_INIT) or
[`SRTS_OPENED`](#SRTS_OPENED) are allowed).


#### SRT_EINVPARAM

This error is reported in a variety of situations when call parameters
for API functions have some requirements defined and these were not
satisfied. This error should be reported after an initial check of the
parameters of the call before even performing any operation. This error
can be easily avoided if you set the values correctly.


#### SRT_EINVSOCK

The API function required an ID of an entity (socket or group) and
it was invalid. Note that some API functions work only with socket or
only with group, so they would also return this error if inappropriate
type of entity was passed, even if it was valid.


#### SRT_EUNBOUNDSOCK

The operation to be performed on a socket requires that it first be explicitly
bound (using [`srt_bind*`](#srt_bind) functions). Currently it applies when
calling [`srt_listen`](#srt_listen), which cannot work with an implicitly
bound socket.


#### SRT_ENOLISTEN

The socket passed for the operation is required to be in the listen
state ([`srt_listen`](#srt_listen) must be called first).


#### SRT_ERDVNOSERV

The required operation cannot be performed when the socket is set to rendezvous
mode ([`SRTO_RENDEZVOUS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RENDEZVOUS) set to true).
Usually applies when trying to call [`srt_listen`](#srt_listen) on such a socket.


#### SRT_ERDVUNBOUND

An attempt was made to connect to a socket set to rendezvous mode
([`SRTO_RENDEZVOUS`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RENDEZVOUS) set to true)
that was not first bound. A rendezvous connection requires setting up two addresses
and ports on both sides of the connection, then setting the local one with
[`srt_bind`](#srt_bind) and using the remote one with [`srt_connect`](#srt_connect)
(or you can simply use [`srt_rendezvous`](#srt_rendezvous)). Calling
[`srt_connect*`](#srt_connect) on an unbound socket (in [`SRTS_INIT`](#SRTS_INIT)
state) that is to be bound implicitly is only allowed for regular caller sockets
(not rendezvous).


#### SRT_EINVALMSGAPI

The function was used incorrectly in the message API. This can happen if:

* The parameters specific for the message API in [`SRT_MSGCTRL`](#SRT_MSGCTRL)
type parameter were incorrectly specified.

* The extra parameter check performed by the congestion controller has failed.

* The socket is a member of a self-managing group, therefore you should
perform the operation on the group, not on this socket.


#### SRT_EINVALBUFFERAPI

The function was used incorrectly in the stream (buffer) API, that is, either the
stream-only functions were used with set message API ([`srt_sendfile`](#srt_sendfile)/[`srt_recvfile`](#srt_recvfile))
or TSBPD mode was used with buffer API ([`SRTO_TSBPDMODE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TSBPDMODE) set to true)
or the congestion controller has failed to check call parameters.


#### SRT_EDUPLISTEN

The port tried to be bound for listening is already busy. Note that binding to the same port
is allowed in general (when [`SRTO_REUSEADDR`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_REUSEADDRS)
is true on every socket that has bound it), but only one such socket can be a listener.


#### SRT_ELARGEMSG

Size exceeded. This is reported in the following situations:

* Trying to receive a message, but the read-ready message is larger than
the buffer passed to the receiving function.

* Trying to send a message, but the size of this message exceeds the
size of the preset sender buffer, so it cannot be stored in the sender buffer.

* When getting group data, the array to be filled is too small.


#### SRT_EINVPOLLID

The epoll ID passed to an epoll function is invalid.


#### SRT_EPOLLEMPTY

The epoll container currently has no subscribed sockets. This is reported by an
epoll waiting function that would in this case block forever. This problem
might be reported both in a situation where you have created a new epoll
container and didn't subscribe any sockets to it, or you did, but these
sockets have been closed (including when closed in a separate thread while the
waiting function was blocking). Note that this situation can be prevented
by setting the `SRT_EPOLL_ENABLE_EMPTY` flag, which may be useful when
you use multiple threads and start waiting without subscribed sockets, so that
you can subscribe them later from another thread.


#### `SRT_EBINDCONFLICT`

The binding you are attempting to set up a socket with cannot be completed because
it conflicts with another existing binding. This is because an intersecting binding
was found that cannot be reused according to the specification in `srt_bind` call.

A binding is considered intersecting if the existing binding has the same port
and covers at least partially the range as that of the attempted binding. These
ranges can be split in three groups:

1. An explicitly specified IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6) covers this address only.
2. An IPv4 wildcard 0.0.0.0 covers all IPv4 addresses (but not IPv6).
3. An IPv6 wildcard :: covers:
   * if `SRTO_IPV6ONLY` is true - all IPv6 addresses (but not IPv4)
   * if `SRTO_IPV6ONLY` is false - all IP addresses.

Example 1:

* Socket 1: bind to IPv4 0.0.0.0
* Socket 2: bind to IPv6 :: with `SRTO_IPV6ONLY` = true
* Result: NOT intersecting

Example 2:

* Socket 1: bind to IPv4 1.2.3.4
* Socket 2: bind to IPv4 0.0.0.0
* Result: intersecting (and conflicting)

Example 3:

* Socket 1: bind to IPv4 1.2.3.4
* Socket 2: bind to IPv6 :: with `SRTO_IPV6ONLY` = false
* Result: intersecting (and conflicting)

If any common range coverage is found between the attempted binding specification
(in `srt_bind` call) and the found existing binding with the same port number,
then all of the following conditions must be satisfied between them:

1. The `SRTO_REUSEADDR` must be true (default) in both.

2. The IP address specification (in case of IPv6, also including the value of
`SRTO_IPV6ONLY` flag) must be exactly identical.

3. The UDP-specific settings must be identical.

If any of these conditions isn't satisfied, the `srt_bind` function results
in conflict and report this error.

#### SRT_EASYNCFAIL

General asynchronous failure (not in use currently).


#### SRT_EASYNCSND

Sending operation is not ready to perform. This error is reported when trying to
perform a sending operation on a socket that is not ready for sending, but
[`SRTO_SNDSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_SNDSYN) was set to false (when
true, the function would block the call otherwise).


#### SRT_EASYNCRCV

Receiving operation is not ready to perform. This error is reported when trying to
perform a receiving operation or accept a new socket from the listener socket, when
the socket is not ready for that operation, but [`SRTO_RCVSYN`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVSYN)
was set to false (when true, the function would block the call otherwise).


#### SRT_ETIMEOUT

The operation timed out. This can happen if you have a timeout set by an option
([`SRTO_RCVTIMEO`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_RCVTIMEO) or
[`SRTO_SNDTIMEO`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_SNDTIMEO)), or passed as an
extra argument ([`srt_epoll_wait`](#srt_epoll_wait) or [`srt_accept_bond`](#srt_accept_bond))
and the function call was blocking, but the required timeout time has passed.


#### SRT_ECONGEST

**NOTE**: This error is used only in an experimental version that requires
setting the `SRT_ENABLE_ECN` macro at compile time. Otherwise the situation
described below results in the usual successful report.

This error should be reported by the sending function when, with
[`SRTO_TSBPDMODE`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TSBPDMODE) and
[`SRTO_TLPKTDROP`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TLPKTDROP) set to true, some
packets were dropped at the sender side (see the description of
[`SRTO_TLPKTDROP`](API-socket-options.md#SRTO_TLPKTDROP) for details). This
doesn't concern the data that were passed for sending by the sending function
(these data are placed at the back of the sender buffer, while the dropped
packets are at the front). In other words, the operation done by the sending
function is successful, but the application might want to slow down the sending
rate to avoid congestion.


#### SRT_EPEERERR

This error is reported when a receiver peer is writing to a file that an agent
is sending. When the peer encounters an error when writing the received data to
a file, it sends the `UMSG_PEERERROR` message back to the sender, and the sender
reports this error from the API sending function.
