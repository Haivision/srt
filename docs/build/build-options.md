# Build System

The SRT build system uses [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) 2.8.12 or above.

A wrapper script named [`configure`](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/configure)
is also available. The `configure` script can simplify the build process, such as
by trying to automatically detect the OpenSSL path in a system. Note that you must
have the Tcl interpreter installed to use this script.


Here is a link to a demo showing how CMake can be used to build SRT:
[Quickstart: Running SRT and FFmpeg on Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOtUOVhussc&t=5s).


Additional information on building for Windows is available in the
[Building SRT for Windows](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/docs/build/build-win.md)
document and in the [SRT CookBook](https://srtlab.github.io/srt-cookbook/getting-started/build-on-windows/).

## Using CMake

If you choose to use CMake directly for the build configuration stage, you must
specify option values in the CMake format:

`-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`

For more information please refer to the [official CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/).

The following example shows how to disable the inclusion of sample SRT applications
(such as `srt-live-transmit`) in the build configuration, where `./` specifies
the relative path to the main `CMakeLists.txt` file located in the root folder
of the SRT project.

In this example CMake is run from the root SRT directory:

```cmake
cmake ./ -DENABLE_APPS=OFF
```


SRT build options known to CMake are listed in the
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) file as:

`option(<name> <description> <default value>)`.

For example:

`option(CYGWIN_USE_POSIX "Should the POSIX API be used for cygwin. Ignored if the system isn't cygwin." OFF)
`
With CMake you would specify this option as:

`cmake -DCYGWIN_USE_POSIX=ON` or `cmake -DCYGWIN_USE_POSIX=OFF`

where “-D” is the CMake command to set a build variable to a certain value.



## Using the Configure Script

This script is similar in design to the
[Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)
`configure` script, and so accepts `--long-options`, with or without values. It
handles two kinds of options:

* options that are directly translated to `cmake` variables.

* special options to be resolved inside the script that may do some
advanced checks; these should later be converted into a set of specific `cmake`
variable declarations

The directly translated options always undergo a simple transformation:

* all letters are converted to uppercase
* dashes are converted to underscores
* plus (+) symbols are converted to X
* when no value is supplied, a default value of 1 is applied

To set the `CYGWIN_USE_POSIX` option using the configure script you would call

`configure --cygwin-use-posix`

which is transformed by the script into `-DCYGWIN-USE-POSIX` and then passed
to `cmake` to enable POSIX (set to ON). To disable the option (set to OFF) using
the configure script you would call

`configure –-disable-cygwin-use-posix`

In another example, to enable compiling in C++11 mode with the CMake command
`ENABLE-C++11` using the configure script you would call

`configure --enable-c++11`

which is transformed by the script into `-DENABLE_CXX11=1` and then passed
to `cmake`.

Additionally, if you specify `--disable-<X>`, the `configure` script
will automatically turn it into an associated `--enable-<X>` option,
 passing `0` as its value. For example, `--disable-encryption` will
be translated for `cmake` into `-DENABLE_ENCRYPTION=0`.


## Build Options

The CMake options available for building SRT are listed below, along with the
equivalent `configure` format.


#### CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
**`--cmake-install-prefix=<path>`**

Used to configure an alias to the `--cmake-install-prefix` variable that
establishes the root directory for installation, inside of which a GNU/POSIX
compatible directory layout will be used. As on all known build systems, this
defaults to `/usr/local` on GNU/POSIX compatible systems, with lower level
GNU/POSIX directories created inside: `/usr/local/bin`,`/usr/local/lib`, etc.


#### CYGWIN_USE_POSIX
**`--cygwin-use-posix`** (default:OFF)

Set to ON to compile SRT on Cygwin using the POSIX API (otherwise it will use
MinGW environment).


#### ENABLE_APPS
**`--enable-apps`** (default: ON)

Enables compiling user applications.

#### ENABLE_BONDING
**`--enable-bonding`** (default: OFF)

Enables the [Connection Bonding](../features/bonding-quick-start.md) feature.

Similar to SMPTE-2022-7 over managed networks, Connection Bonding adds seamless stream protection and hitless failover to the SRT protocol. This technology relies on more than one IP network path to prevent disruption to live video streams in the event of network congestion or outages, maintaining continuity of service.

This is accomplished using the [socket groups](../features/socket-groups.md) introduced in [SRT v1.5](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/releases/tag/v1.5.0). The general concept of socket groups means having a group that contains multiple sockets, where one operation for sending one data signal is applied to the group. Single sockets inside the group will take over this operation and do what is necessary to deliver the signal to the receiver.

Two modes are supported:

- [Broadcast](../features/socket-groups.md#1-broadcast) - In *Broadcast* mode, data is sent redundantly over all the member links in a group. If one of the links fails or experiences network jitter and/or packet loss, the missing data will be received over another link in the group. Redundant packets are simply discarded at the receiver side.

- [Main/Backup](../features/bonding-main-backup.md) - In *Main/Backup* mode, only one (main) link at a time is used for data transmission while other (backup) connections are on standby to ensure the transmission will continue if the main link fails. The goal of Main/Backup mode is to identify a potential link break before it happens, thus providing a time window within which to seamlessly switch to one of the backup links.

With the Connection Bonding feature disabled, [bonding API functions](../API/API-functions.md#socket-group-management) are present, but return an error.


#### ENABLE_CXX_DEPS
**`--enable-c++-deps`** (default: OFF)

When ON, the `pkg-confg` file (`srt.pc`) will be generated with the `libstdc++`
library as a dependency. This may be required in some cases where you have an
application written in C which therefore won't link against `libstdc++` by default.


#### ENABLE_CXX11
**`--enable-c++11`** (default: ON except for GCC<4.7)

When ON, enables compiling in C++11 mode for those components that may require it.
Components that don't require it will still be compiled in C++03 mode,
although which components are affected may change in future.

If this option is turned OFF, it affects building a project in two ways:

* an alternative C++03 implementation can be used, if available
* otherwise the component that requires it will be disabled

Components that currently require C++11 and have no alternative implementation
are:

* unit tests
* user and testing applications (such as `srt-live-transmit`)
* some of the example applications

It should be possible to compile the SRT library without C++11 support. However,
any alternative C++03 implementation may be unsupported on certain platforms.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE
**`--enable-code-coverage`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables instrumentation for code coverage. Note that this is only available
on platforms with a GNU-compatible compiler.


#### ENABLE_DEBUG
**`--enable-debug=<0,1,2>`**

This option allows control through the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable:

* 0 (default): `Release` (highly optimized, no debug info)
* 1: `Debug` (not optimized, full debug info)
* 2: `RelWithDebInfo` (highly optimized, but with debug info)

Please note that when the value is other than 0, the
[`--enable-heavy-logging`](#enable-heavy-logging) option is also turned ON by default.


#### ENABLE_ENCRYPTION
**`--enable-encryption`** (default: ON)

When ON, the encryption feature is enabled. This involves a dependency on an
external encryption library (default: [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)).
If you disable encryption, the library will be unable to set encryption options.
It will be compatible with a peer that has encryption enabled, but just won't
use encryption for the connection.


#### ENABLE_AEAD_API_PREVIEW
**`--enable-aead-api-preview`** (default: OFF)

When ON, the AEAD API is enabled. The `ENABLE_ENCRYPTION` must be enabled as well.
The AEAD functionality is only available if either OpenSSL EVP or Botan is selected
as the crypto provider:
build option `-DUSE_ENCLIB=[openssl-evp | botan]`.

The AEAD API is to be official in SRT v1.6.0.

#### ENABLE_MAXREXMITBW
**`--enable-maxrexmitbw`** (default: OFF)

When ON, the `SRTO_MAXREXMITBW` is enabled (to become official in SRT v1.6.0).


#### ENABLE_GETNAMEINFO
**`--enable-getnameinfo`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables the use of `getnameinfo` with options that allow using reverse
DNS to resolve an internal IP address into a readable internet domain name, so
that it can be shown nicely in the log file. This option is turned OFF by default
because it may have an impact on general performance. It is recommended only for
development when testing on a local network.


#### ENABLE_HAICRYPT_LOGGING
**`--enable-haicrypt-logging`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables logging in the *haicrypt* module, which serves as a connector to
an encryption library. Logging here might be seen as unsafe, therefore this
option is turned OFF by default.

The log corresponds to the `HAICRYPT` functional area.
Enabling `HAICRYPT` logging in the build does not enable the `HAICRYPT` functional area
in the logging configuration.

Please use the
[`srt_addlogfa(SRT_LOGFA_HAICRYPT)`](../API/API-functions.md#srt_addlogfa)
to enable `HAICRYPT` logging via the SRT API.
To enable the logging in `srt-live-transmit` use `--logfa haicrypt`
in combination with the required `--loglevel`.

[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### ENABLE_HEAVY_LOGGING
**`--enable-heavy-logging`** (default: OFF in release mode)

When ON, this option enables logging instructions in the code, which are considered
heavy as they occur often and cover many detailed aspects of library behavior.
Turning this option ON will allow you to use the `debug` level of logging and get
detailed information as to what happens inside the library. Note, however, that
this may influence processing by changing timings, use less preferred thread
switching layouts, and generally worsen the functionality and performance of
the library. For these reasons this option is turned OFF by default.


#### ENABLE_INET_PTON
**`--enable-inet-pton`** (default: ON)

When ON, enables usage of the `inet_pton` function by applications, which should
be used to resolve the network endpoint name into an IP address. This may not be
available in some versions of Microsoft Windows, in which case you can change the
setting to OFF. When this option is OFF, however, IP addresses cannot be resolved
by name, as the `inet_pton` function gets a poor-man's simple replacement that can
only resolve numeric IPv4 addresses.


#### ENABLE_LOGGING
**`--enable-logging`** (default: ON)

When ON, enables logging. When you turn this option OFF, the library will not
report any runtime information, including errors, through the logging system. This
option may be useful if you suspect the logging system of impairing performance.


#### ENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK
**`--enable-monotonic-clock`** (default: OFF)

**NOTE**: The library can get stuck if the system clock is used instead of
monotonic or C++11 steady. Since v1.4.4 `ENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK` is enabled by
default on POSIX-type systems if support for CLOCK_MONOTONIC is detected.
On Windows `ENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC` is enabled by default. It is highly recommended
to use either of those (`ENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC` excludes `ENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK`).

When ON, this option enforces the use of `clock_gettime` to get the current
time, instead of `gettimeofday`. This function forces the use of a monotonic
clock that is independent of the currently set time in the system.
The condition variables (CV), for which the `*_timedwait()` functions are used
with time specification based on the time obtained from `clock_gettime`,
must be appropriately configured. For now, this is only done for the
garbage collector controlling CV, not every CV used in SRT. The consequence
of enabling this option, however, may be portability issues resulting from
the fact that the `clock_gettime` function may be unavailable in some SDKs, or
that an extra `-lrt` option is sometimes required (this requirement will be
autodetected).

The problem is based on the fact that POSIX functions that use timeout
specification (all of `*_timedwait`) expect the absolute time value.
A relative timeout value can be then only specified by adding it to
the current time, which can be specified using either the system or monotonic
clock (as configured in the resources used in the operation).
However the current time of the monotonic clock can only be obtained by
the `clock_gettime` function.

#### ENABLE_PROFILE
**`--enable-profile`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables code instrumentation for profiling (only available for
GNU-compatible compilers).


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### ENABLE_RELATIVE_LIBPATH
**`--enable-relative-libpath`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables adding a relative path to a library. This allows applications to
be linked against a shared SRT library by reaching out to a sibling `../lib`
directory, provided that the library and applications are installed in POSIX/GNU
style directories. This might be useful when installing SRT and applications
in a directory in which the library subdirectory is not explicitly defined
among the global library paths. Consider, for example, this application and its
required library:

* `/opt/srt/bin/srt-live-transmit`
* `/opt/srt/lib64/libsrt.so`

By using the `--enable-relative-libpath` option, the `srt-live-transmit`
application has a relative library path defined inside as `../lib64`. A dynamic
linker will find the required `libsrt.so` file by this path: `../lib64/libsrt.so`.
This way the dynamic linkage will work even if the `/opt/srt/lib64` path isn't added
to the system paths in `/etc/ld.so.conf` or in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable.

This option is OFF by default because of reports that it may cause problems with
default installations.


#### ENABLE_SHARED | ENABLE_STATIC
**`--enable-shared`** and **`--enable-static`** (default for both: ON)

When ON, enables building SRT as a shared and/or static library, as required for
your application. In practice, you would only disable one or the other
(e.g. by `--disable-shared`). Note that you can't disable both at once.


#### ENABLE_SHOW_PROJECT_CONFIG
**`--enable-show-project-config`** (default:OFF)

When ON, the project configuration is displayed at the end of the CMake
configuration step of the build process.


#### ENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC
**`--enable-stdcxx-sync`** (default: OFF)

**NOTE**: The library can get stuck if the system clock is used instead of
monotonic or C++11 steady. Since v1.4.4 `ENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC`is enabled by
default on Windows. On POSIX-type systems, an alternative `ENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK` option is enabled by default if support for CLOCK_MONOTONIC is detected. It is highly recommended
to use either of those (`ENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC` excludes `ENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK`).

When ON, this option enables the standard C++ `thread` and `chrono` libraries
(available since C++11) to be used by SRT instead of the `pthreads` libraries.

#### ENABLE_PKTINFO
**`--enable-pktinfo`** (default: OFF)

This allows the use of the `IP_PKTINFO` control message to extract the true target IP
address from the incoming UDP packets to a listener bound to "any" address. The "any"
address is defined in IPv4 as 0.0.0.0 (`INADDR_ANY`) and in IPv6 as :: (`in6addr_any`).
Applications usually implement it by clearing the `sockaddr*` structure and only setting
the port number. This true address can then be used to override the source IP address
when sending packets to the peer. This solves the problem where routing rules
in an agent's host send a packet using a different source IP address than the  target
IP address in the UDP packet from the peer. The peer will reject such a packet as a
suspected man-in-the-middle (MITM) attempt, leading to a connection failure.

This problem has been observed where an agent's host has at least
two IP addresses that share the same broadcast prefix, and it is being contacted
by a peer using an address other than the first one. For example:

The host has set the following local IP addresses:

  (1) 192.168.10.5 - routing to 192.168.10.1
  (2) 10.10.5.10 - routing to 10.10.5.1
  (3) 10.10.5.20 - routing to 10.10.5.1

For all of them the netmask is 255.255.255.0, which means that the second
and third IP addresses share the same broadcast prefix (10.10.5.0).
The problem occurs when an agent running on this host is contacted
by a peer using the address 10.10.5.20.

In such a case the source address set in the UDP packet being sent will
always be the first of these addresses (10.10.5.10), which will be different
from the one from which the packet is actually being sent (10.10.5.20).
The peer will then reject such a packet because its source address is different.

This problem occurs only with listener sockets bound to "any" address - when it
is bound to a specific IP address, this will be always set as source address
for outgoing packets.

By enabling this feature SRT mitigates the problem by first reading the real
target IP address from the incoming handshake packet, and then forcing this
specific address to be set in the source address field of every UDP packet sent
from this socket. This behavior is also consistent with TCP.

Note that this feature is available only on certain platforms. Notably the BSD
systems are known to not provide this feature and the current implementation
doesn't support this feature on Windows systems.


#### ENABLE_TESTING
**`--enable-testing`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables compiling of developer testing applications.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)



#### ENABLE_THREAD_CHECK
**`--enable-thread-check`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables `#include <threadcheck.h>`, which implements `THREAD_*` macros
to support better thread debugging. Included to support an existing project.


#### ENABLE_UNITTESTS
**`--enable-unittests`** (default: OFF)

When ON, this option enables unit tests, possibly with the download
and installation of the Google test library in the build directory. The tests
will be run as part of the build process. This is intended for developers only.


#### OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY
**`--openssl-crypto-library=<filepath>`**

Used to configure the path to an OpenSSL crypto library. Ignored when encryption
is disabled (ENABLE_ENCRYPTION = OFF). See [`USE_ENCLIB`](#use_enclib) for the list of supported libraries.

[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR
**`--openssl-include-dir=<path>`**

Used to configure the path to include files for an OpenSSL library.


#### OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY
**`--openssl-ssl-library=<filepath>`**

Used to configure the path to an OpenSSL SSL library.


#### PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE
**`--pkg-config-executable=<filepath>`**

Used to configure the path to the `pkg-config` tool.

[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### PTHREAD_INCLUDE_DIR
**`--pthread-include-dir=<path>`**

Used to configure the path to include files for a `pthread` library. Note that
this is useful only on Windows. On Linux and macOS this path should be available
in the system.


#### PTHREAD_LIBRARY
**`--pthread-library=<filepath>`**

Used to configure the path to a `pthread` library.


#### SRT_LOG_SLOWDOWN_FREQ_MS
**`--srt-log-slowdown-freq-ms=<ms>`** (DEFAULT 1000 ms; or 0 ms if `ENABLE_HEAVY_LOGGING`)

Reduce the frequency of some frequent logs, milliseconds.

- Decryption failure warning message (`SRT_LOGFA_QUE_RECV`).


#### USE_BUSY_WAITING
**`--use-busy-waiting`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enables more accurate sending times at the cost of potentially higher
CPU load.

This option will cause more empty loop running, which may cause more CPU usage.
Keep in mind, however, that when processing high bitrate streams the share of
empty loop runs will decrease as the bitrate increases. This way higher CPU
usage would still be productive, while without system-supported waiting this
option may increase the likelihood of switching to the right thread at the time
when it is expected to be revived.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### USE_CXX_STD
**`--use-c++-std=<standard>`**

Enforces using a particular C++ standard when compiling. When using this option
remember that:

* Allowed values are: 98, 03, 11, 14, 17 and 20
* If you use 98/03 and `--enable-apps`, apps will be still using C++11
* This option is only supported on GNU and Clang compilers (will be ignored on others).


#### USE_ENCLIB
**`--use-enclib=<name>`**

Encryption library to be used. Possible options for `<name>`:

* openssl-evp (default)
* openssl 
* gnutls (with nettle)
* mbedtls
* botan


#### USE_GNUSTL
**`--use-gnustl`**

Use `pkg-config` with the `gnustl` package name to extract the header and
library path for the C++ standard library (instead of using the compiler
built-in one).


#### USE_OPENSSL_PC
**`--use-openssl-pc`** (default: ON)

When ON, uses `pkg-config` to find OpenSSL libraries. You can turn this OFF to
force `cmake` to find OpenSSL by its own preferred method.

### OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS
**`--openssl-use-static-libs`** (default: OFF)

When ON, OpenSSL libraries are linked statically.
When `pkg-config`(`-DUSE_OPENSSL_PC=ON`) is used, static OpenSSL libraries are listed in `SSL_STATIC_LIBRARIES`. See `<prefix>_STATIC` in [CMake's FindPkgConfig](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPkgConfig.html).
On Windows additionally links `crypt32.lib`.

#### USE_STATIC_LIBSTDCXX
**`--use-static-libstdc++`** (default: OFF)

When ON, enforces linking the SRT library against the static `libstdc++` library.
This may be useful if you are using SRT library in an environment where it would
by default link against the wrong version of the C++ standard library, or when
the library in the version used by the compiler is not available as shared.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### WITH_COMPILER_PREFIX
**`--with-compiler-prefix=<prefix>`**

Sets C/C++ toolchains as `<prefix><c-compiler>` and `<prefix><c++-compiler>`.

This option will override the default compiler autodetected by `cmake`.
It is handled inside `cmake`. It sets the variables `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and
`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`. The values for the above `<c-compiler>` and `<c++-compiler>`
are controlled by the [`--with-compiler-type`](#with-compiler-type) option.
When this option is not supplied, one of the following system-default compilers
will be used:

* On Mac OS (Darwin): clang
* On other POSIX systems: gcc
* On other systems: compiler obtained from the `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` variable

Instead of `--with-compiler-prefix` you can use [`--cmake-c-compiler`](#cmake-c-compiler)
and [`--cmake-c++-compiler`](#cmake-c++-compiler) options. This can be thought of
as a shortcut, useful when you have a long path to the compiler command.

NOTE: The specified prefix is meant to simply precede the compiler type. If your
prefix is a full path to the compiler, it must include the terminal path
separator character, as this can also be used as a prefix for a platform-specific
cross compiler. For example, if the path to the C compiler is:

`/opt/arm-tc/bin/arm-linux-gnu-gcc-7.4`,

then you should specify:

`--with-compiler-prefix=/opt/arm-tc/bin/arm-linux-gnu-`
and `--with-compiler-type=gcc-7.4`.


#### WITH_COMPILER_TYPE
**`--with-compiler-type=<name>`**

Sets the compiler type to be used as `<c-compiler>` and `<c++-compiler>`
respectively:

* gcc (default): gcc and g++
* cc: cc and c++
* others: use `<name>` as C compiler and `<name>++` as C++ compiler

This should be the exact command used when specifying a C compiler, possibly
with version suffix, e.g. `clang-1.7.0`. If this option is used together
with `--with-compiler-prefix`, its prefix will be added in front.


[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)


#### WITH_EXTRALIBS
**`--with-extralibs=<library-list>`**

This is an option for unusual situations where a platform-specific
workaround is needed, and some extra libraries must be passed explicitly
for linkage. The argument is a space-separated list of linker options
or library names.

There are some known situations where it may be necessary:

1. Some older Linux systems do not ship `clock_gettime` functions by
default in their `libc`, and need an extra `librt`. If you are using POSIX
monotonic clocks (see [`--enable-monotonic-clock`](#enable-monotonic-clock)), it
might be required to add `-lrd` through this option. Although this situation is
usually autodetected (and the option added automatically), it does sometimes fail.

2. On some systems (e.g. OpenSuSE), if you use C++11 sync
(see [`--enable-stdc++-sync`](#enable-stdc++-sync)), the gcc compiler relies on
`gthreads`, which relies on `pthreads`, and happens to define inline source
functions in the header that refer to `pthread_create`. The compiler, however,
doesn't link against `pthreads` by default. To work around this, add `-pthreads`
using this option.


#### WITH_SRT_NAME
**`--with-srt-name=<prefix>`**

Overrides the SRT library name, adding a custom `<prefix>`



[:arrow_up: &nbsp; Back to List of Build Options](#list-of-build-options)
