 .SYNOPSIS

  Download, expand and install OpenSSL for Windows.

 .PARAMETER ForceDownload

  Force a download even if the OpenSSL installers are already downloaded.

 .PARAMETER NoInstall

  Do not install the OpenSSL packages. By default, OpenSSL is installed.

 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.

# A bit of history: Where to load OpenSSL binaries from?
#
# The packages are built by "slproweb". The binaries are downloadable from
# their Web page at: http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
#
# Initially, the HTML for this page was built on server-side. This script
# grabbed the URL content, parse the HTML and extracted the URL of the
# binaries for the latest OpenSSL packages from the "href" of the links.
#
# At some point in 2024, the site changed policy. The Web page is no longer
# built on server-side, but on client-side. The downloaded HTML contains some
# JavaScript which dynamically builds the URL of the binaries for the latest
# OpenSSL binaries. The previous method now finds no valid package URL from
# the downloaded page (a full browser is needed to execute the JavaScript).
# The JavaScript downloads a JSON file which contains all references to
# the OpenSSL binaries. This script now uses the same method: download that
# JSON file and parse it.
